## Authors: Charlotte Fleury, Rita Sefraoui Tahiri, Astrid Wiedmer & Alexandre Schroeter
## Presented to the text mining course (Fall 19) taught by Dr. Marc-Olivier Boldi
Welcome on our repository for a project of text mining where we try to apply text mining techniques on sunscreen reviews from the website [makeupalley](https://www.makeupalley.com/) and from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).

## Objective
This report has made focused on a binary classification task to identify healthy individuals from those infected by COVID-19, and also a multi-class classification where the task is to identify COVID19+ from healthy individuals or those infected with viral and bacterial pneumonia.

## Structure of the <a href="https://github.com/schroeti/textmining" target="_blank">repository</a> 
### Data
This folder contains the scrapped reviews of 12 different brands of sunscreen from MakeUpAlley. 

### Report
This folder contains different scripts used for the creation of the report on the homepage. It includes preprocessing the data (text cleaning), performing sentiment analyses, identifying similarities within corpuses, word embedding and using supervised learning to predict the brand associated with a specific review.
