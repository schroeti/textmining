I have never experienced the &quot;pills&quot; or &quot;greasy look&quot; everyone is complaining about. It has never stung my skin and I NEVER PUT IT AROUND MY EYE AREA. The skin around the eyes is the most delicate area on your face. 

When I apply this product, I only use about a dime-sized amount, and I pat it on with my middle and ring fingers only. After that, I apply my moisture in the same fashion, followed by my eye cream.( I don&#039;t wear foundation)

I&#039;ve noticed that my skin looks so much better when I use the sunblock.( I&#039;m so bad. I know you must wear it everyday religiously) 

I will always continue to purchase this product, it&#039;s the best sunblock out there. Oh, and I don&#039;t mind the sunblock smell, it reminds me of the beach and summer days spent by the pool.

THIS formula however, while still smelling like sunblock, is perfect on my sensitive skin, and a brilliant base for my MSFN. I honestly don&#039;t think users are thinking of the right product.

I really like this sunscreen and have not experienced any of the problems that others have. Unlike Dry Touch and Banana Boat, both of which balled up horribly under makeup. - the Age Shield is light, fluffy, and sinks right in. I also find that my chin is less clogged than it is when I used Dry Touch over the past several years. I think people must be using way too much of this, because I don&#039;t find it greasy and it does not sting for me. Due to its consistency, I only need about half a teaspoon for my face. I wait for my Vitamin C serum to sink in then apply (no moisturizer needed). I then try to wait about 5 minutes before applying makeup.  I also shake it to get the product out so thats probably how I avoided ever seeing the runniness or the yellowy watery gunk. Finally, I never noticed a lingering smell to it.

74,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,74107,Age Shield Sunblock Spf45,3,"I actually have this in SPF 55.  Retails for $10 USD at drugstores but you can definitely save some money stocking up on it during the summer months with all the sales.  I&#039;m rather impressed with this.  It feels less heavy than the Ultra Sheer and it absorbed well and moisturized my face just enough (I have combo/oily).  I didn&#039;t put on any moisturizer, just this and applied my foundation.  Both are holding up well.  I do think it made my eyes sting ever so slightly for about 10 minutes.  I have chronic dry eye and use many eye drops so my eye sensitivity is a bit extreme.  I&#039;ll probably continue to use this on my face and steer clear of my eyes.  I&#039;ll have to use something different around them.  The SPF 55 version is photo-stable like the SPF 45.  It dries to a soft touch, not exactly ultra-lightweight but it does feel lightweight unlike a typical sunscreen.   The slight sunscreen odor fades quickly.

UPDATE 7-15-08:  Now that I am living in an ultra-high humidity area, I am no longer in love with this stuff.  It makes my face look oily no matter what powders or mattifiers I put on.  It also makes my makeup melt right off.

I have found that I absolutely cannot touch my face before applying liquid foundation or else the sunscreen will ball up and flake. (Once I&#039;ve applied foundation, it&#039;s fine. Go figure.) I don&#039;t normally spend long amounts of time in the sun at peak hours to sufficiently put it to the test, but I did attend an afternoon outdoor party recently and did not experience any sunburn.

I LOVE this stuff and will continue to use it in the areas I&#039;m using it now.  Finally, a sunscreen I love!
Update 6/9/06: I will say that now I experience the &quot;roll off&quot; that people are talking about, but I&#039;m wondering if maybe I put it on this morning over body lotion and that&#039;s why.  I have it on my forearms and unfortunately keep brushing them against my black pants so now I have white residue on my black pants.  I still give it the same rating, though.  It is excellent.",2006-05-24T12:26:00.000Z,810592,,EstheticianJen,0,Combination,Unknown,Unknown,Other,Unknown,Unknown,Hazel,30-35,77
74,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,74107,Age Shield Sunblock Spf45,4,"I actually like this sunscreen, despite the bad reviews. I have normal to oily skin. I normally use Oil of Olay or my Clinique Active white foundation SPF 20, but on days I will be outside for several hours, I apply this under makeup, after I wash my face. Doesn&#039;t burn, clump, or get ball-y on me. I&#039;m lucky to have smooth even non-sensitive skin, so that may be why I&#039;m the minority here. It absorbed quickly into my skin, felt weightless, and didn&#039;t make my face look greasy at all. Overall, I plan to use this a lot during the summer months and would repurchase.",2006-05-22T11:36:00.000Z,809385,,sweetcaroline,0,Oily,Other,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,25-29,294
74,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,74107,Age Shield Sunblock Spf45,1,"Since I work out everyday after lunchtime, I have to shower an reapply my sunscreen twice a day.  I needed a cheaper alternative to my expensive Lancome Beinfait, which I love.  I decided to try this and after a month I am giving up.  First off, I never had a sunscreeen ball up like this one.  It makes a complete mess.  It seems matte, but as the day went on, I noticed my powder ( I only wear a little powder and concealer where needed) became very cakey and gross looking.  Plus it caused my powder to turn orange.  The biggest deal breaker:  MAJOR BREAKOUT!! I developed lots of clogged pores and very painful, very big acne.  Also, my face became VERY dry and red.  I stopped using this three days ago and went back to my Lancome.  My face has calmed down and the acne is almost gone.",2006-05-22T09:38:00.000Z,809335,,Carrigan19,0,Other,Unknown,Unknown,Other,Unknown,Unknown,Other,25-29,16
74,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,74107,Age Shield Sunblock Spf45,2,"Hi! I really wanted to like this product. However, I didnt have a great experience with it. I have a combination VERY sensitive skin prone to breakouts. Now I know what was the reason of me getting these huge underskin zits again!! It is a nightmare for me again! Moreover, it doesnt sink in into my skin properly. On a surface it looks like everything is OK, but as soon as I start putting on my liquid foundation Clinique, the suncreen comes down of my skin and the picture is not very attractive. I thought that the problem might have been in using the mousturizer underneath the sunscreen (these days I use Olay total effects with no SPF), so I applied a sunscreen to my face directly. Boy I was wrong! My face started to burn immediately like I got one of those sunburns! This sunscreen is not a keeper for me, I am glad I saved a receipt!",2006-05-19T05:11:00.000Z,807614,,knatasha2000,0,Combination,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,25-29,14
74,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,74107,Age Shield Sunblock Spf45,2,"I had been using the Dry Touch spf 45, which wasn&#039;t too bad but balled up under makeup. Also, I had heard that Age Shield is photostable and Dry Touch isn&#039;t. Unfortunately, my skin doesn&#039;t like this at all. My makeup refuses to go on smoothly, even after I let this soak into my skin for 20 minutes for so. It left me extremely shiny and greasy looking. The worst part, though, is that my face looks rough and is breaking out like I haven&#039;t done in several years. I&#039;m even getting a few pimples on my shoulders from this, yikes.

74,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,74107,Age Shield Sunblock Spf45,2,"This product was so promising for me. Amazing sun protection, photostable, lots of antioxidants. However, I am *sooo* annoyed with Neutrogena for putting silicates in their sunscreens. I can&#039;t use ultra dry-touch for this reason, and now I find I can&#039;t use age shield either. Silica is really the only skin-product additive that consistently gives me pimples. :(",2006-04-15T05:03:00.000Z,786541,,glossycandy,0,Normal,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Black,25-29,77
74,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,74107,Age Shield Sunblock Spf45,5,"This sunscreen gets 10 lippies because my DH really likes it and actually wears it daily.  It is stable, fragrance free,contains antioxidants and dries to a nice matte finish.  Although it is thick, his oily skin has had no problems with it.  My combo skin didn&#039;t like this as much.  The silica made it a little too drying for me, though I will say that it seemed less drying than the Dry Touch.  Also, it didn&#039;t play nice with my HA serum (rolled into some flakes)  But it still think it might be a good option for my body come summer.  In any event, it is definitely worth trying.

74,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,74107,Age Shield Sunblock Spf45,3,"This sunblock is thick, but it absorbs into my skin super fast, and doesn&#039;t leave a white film. I like it, but I don&#039;t love it. It feels a little heavy on my skin, and for an oily girl like me, I prefer something lighter. Also, the product claims to be oil-free, but hmmm? I don&#039;t think it is because my face felt slick after the initial application. I really question that. Also, it did ball up a little. It also claims to be fragrance free, but there is a sunscreen scent. Unless it starts to break me out, I will try to use it up, but I don&#039;t think I would purchase it again. I&#039;m going to try the spf55, which I am hoping it won&#039;t be as thick as this sunblock. I really like that this sunblock has anti-oxidants, but I am sure that this Age Shield Sunblock will be too heavy for me in the summer time. This may be perfect for people who just wear powder or no makeup, but with my foundation and a full face of makeup, I felt like my skin was smothered. It was tolerable, but this sunblock felt very obvious on my skin. My makeup seemed to oxidize a little too, but I don&#039;t know if that was just from lighting. Also, I find it interesting that Neutrogena pays the American Cancer Society to use their logo on this product, so Age Shield is actually not endorsed by ACS. It says so right on the box. I know by the ingredients that this sunblock is stable, but promotion of this product is fishy. I don&#039;t doubt it a sunscreen that blocks out damaging UVA &amp; UVB rays and helps with aging, but it&#039;s just not all Neutrogena claims. It feels oily/greasy and isn&#039;t fragrance free like it says on the tube, and it did ball up a little, so it did rub off when I sweat or was removing it at the end of the day. So I guess you can say I am on the fence on this one. It&#039;s definitely not the worst s/s I&#039;ve ever used, but it certainly is not the best one either. UPDATE; I also tried Neutrogena&#039;s spf55, and I prefer the Age Shield. AS is thicker, but I feel like my skin actually absorb it. The spf55 is more dry and just sat on the surface of my skin. I think both are great for the body, but for the face...not impressed. I will stick to my holygrail Hawaiian Tropics Oil-free Faces Spf30. UPDATE: It feels slightly oily because of the high silica content. Also I notice that through out the day, my eyes feel like this sunblock is slightly irritating it.
