I’ve learned to adapt it for all-year wear by mixing it with CeraVe AM moisturizer during cooler months to lighten the shade a tiny bit (it works for me most of the year, but can look a little orange in winter) and keep it from drying my skin out.

It dried me out quite a bit, especially around the eye area, and it&#039;s impossible to remove without an oil-based cleanser -- micellar water is NOT strong enough.  This product looks and feels like Benefit Pore-fessional out of the tube and has a similarly smoothing effect, but the tint is fairly dark and pulls a bit orange on my NW20 skin.  If you&#039;re cool-toned and fair, this probably won&#039;t work for you.  If you have dry skin, moisturize first and be aware that it might not be for you in the long run.  If I had oily skin, I&#039;d be all over this sunscreen, because the price is right for the gigantic tube ($15), and SPF 50 is plenty of sun protection on an everyday basis.

54,1893,Australian Gold ,22,Sunscreen,10,195577,Botanical Tinted Sunscreen Mineral Lotion SPF 50,4,"I love this. I don&#039;t love this. Damn it, there&#039;s nothing consistent about how I really feel about this. Even now in mid - July in Minnesota, where it feels like the tropics, I could never wear this without a ton of moisturizer underneath - and I&#039;m talking, like, Cerave ointment type moisturizer. It does last through long summer days at work without sweating off, which is a huge plus in its favor. It seems to provide good sun protection for regular daytime - that is, work, running errands, etc. It doesn&#039;t have a lot of zinc oxide, which I definitely want for outdoor activities no matter what season it is. I can&#039;t wear this in the cool or cold months at all. That&#039;s an absolute - there&#039;s no moisturizer(s) I could layer underneath that wouldn&#039;t leave me a flake monster by the end of the day. The price is fabulous, which is partly why I&#039;ve tried everything I could think of to make this usable year round.  It&#039;s also one of the very few - as in, 2 - mineral sunscreens that is available in a lot of stores and I don&#039;t have to order on line. The product is very smoothing and does act like a primer - I&#039;ve found it does make my makeup stay in place very well in the heat. You absolutely need an oil based cleanser to get it off at night. This product would be SO perfect for the beach, pool or any water activities, because for all practical purposes, it is impervious to water. And I mean that - after you apply, go ahead &amp; wash your hands. Even dish soap doesnt get this off without multiple washings. The tint makes it hard to wear alone  - I self tan alot &amp; if I&#039;m fairly dark I have to apply some darker concealer and bronzer over this. If it came in more shades that would be more inventive to make it work.

The couple I&#039;d tried prior to this had left me with streaks or a whitecast or a too-matte complexion. This one gives a little hydration, but overall a smooth velvety feel to the face. The colour is perfect - not too warm or dark for me, but blends out into almost nothing on the skin. Definitely could double as a lightweight BB cream.

I took off one lippie though because it&#039;s not that great as a body sunscreen. I tried it a the beach the other day and I thought I had it all blended in but I guess not. A couple hours later, I notice big orange streaks on my arms, which never happens with non-tinted non-mineral sunscreen.

Smoothing
Blurring
Not greasy
No smell
Comfortable on the skin
Great for summer
Good for oily skin
Nice base for makeup
Cheap, 10usd on amazon
Packaging is sanitary

Cons,
The tint isnt pigmented, wish it was more coverage

I bought this because my skin has been pretty clear other than some redness and a few fading acne marks. I have big pores on my cheeks next to my nose and i love how this is so smoothing and blurring. I have combo oily skin, with foundation i get very very greasy, not with this! I dont have to blot for 6 hours, usually i am a greaeball after 2 hours with foundation. I love using this right after moisturizing then i use my Charlotte Tilbury Magic Away for concealing of the undereyes and spots i need to cover. My skin feels good and it can breathe while i get sun protection. This is very light coverage but it does make my skin look better than it is being bare. If you hate white casts, oily sunscreens, or chemical sunscreens then you have to check this out! Its very inexpensive also!

54,1893,Australian Gold ,22,Sunscreen,8,195577,Botanical Tinted Sunscreen Mineral Lotion SPF 50,4,"This is an amazing product which has a combination really hard to find.
It is a bb cream (for me no reason for make-up especially during the summer, maybe just concealer), it is lightweight considering the fact that it&#039;s high protection and the fact that it is WATERPROOF for 90 minutes.
I also use it on my eyes, never causes even the slightest problem even though my LANCOME face sun cream did.
Great &#039;value for money&#039; quantity and quality, the cover could be slightly better to put on and off.
Can fill a little stiff on the areas on my face which are a little dry, but otherwise not cakey.
When you apply it, can feel red/orange but after a few minutes adapts to your skin tone, a characteristic that actually belongs to cc creams.
Happy I found it in central Europe, and very good company policy about the parcel (bought only one product, got sent a small present and leaflet about the whole series, not everyone does that nowadays).",2019-06-15T08:45:36.000Z,3055609,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3249276.JPG,Pocha92,8,Combination,Tan,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,25-29,1

54,1893,Australian Gold ,22,Sunscreen,7,195577,Botanical Tinted Sunscreen Mineral Lotion SPF 50,5,"My Canadian makeup buddy, Redwings, praised this sunscreen in past and I became very keen to try it but couldn&#039;t find it in-store anywhere and Amazon.ca doesn&#039;t carry this tinted facial formula.  So I was delighted to see that Shoppers Drug Mart is now carrying a pretty full range of Australian Gold sunscreen products, including this one.  I&#039;ve only been using it for 3 days but already I am so delighted and think this will become my go-to facial sun protection product, possibly pushing LRP&#039;s Anthelios milky liquid out of first place because of the almost flaking look it can sometimes give my face if I have even the slightest bit of dry skin.  This AG product doesn&#039;t do that and doesn&#039;t emphasize texture at all.  It looks perfectly natural and on my fair skin, the &quot;tint&quot;, such as it is, is almost imperceptible and, if anything, just imparts the slightest bit of healthy warmth.

As a fair skinned person I was disappointed to see that it was tinted because usually tinted sunscreens look too orange or just too dark on my skin. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this seems to adjust to my skin tone, creating a blurring effect (it even worked on my husband who had NO idea I was applying something tinted to his face and later asked me why his skin looked so perfect - LOL). It spreads nicely and is forgiving; no streaking. It leaves the skin looking even toned and matte. Plays very well with make up - doesn’t pill, and actually has a primer like effect, helping make up go on more smoothly! The downsides - it almost leaves my face too matte, while I prefer a more dewy finish. It can also be a little drying. This stuff doesn’t budge which can be good, but it kinda sucks at the end of the day to remove.

It actually makes a fantastic primer under foundation as I’ve forgot to apply primer and my makeup has applied beautifully and worn extremely well throughout the day.

It has a primer-like texture that goes on really well under MU. It is not greasy at all, and looks great without any makeup on, too. Since is tinted, it does not leave any kind of detectable white cast, as other mineral SPF do (actually, the Australian Gold SPF 30 mineral sunscreen leaves has a similar texture, but leaves a super noticeable white cast, as it is not tinted). 

I acknowledge that it has a strong fragrance, but I happen to like it and hasn&#039;t bothered my skin. 

It is quite pricy where I live, and difficult to find, especially during the colder months. 

Finally, I wish it came in a pump; I don’t like the tube, as I find it difficult to get all of the product out as it runs out.

54,1893,Australian Gold ,22,Sunscreen,15,195577,Botanical Tinted Sunscreen Mineral Lotion SPF 50,5,"This is my HG sunscreen. I use it on my face and chest (which is sun damaged and red) daily, and I love the light coverage and primer-like blurring. I frequently use just this and concealer and love that there’s still some roses in my cheeks and freckles peeking through. I find it comfortable, and not drying at all, so ymmv based on other’s complaints. This stuff gives you plenty of time to rub it in, and once it sets, it does.not.budge. 

That actually leads me to some cons (that I’m willing to live with): it does not play well with every type of makeup. I use a waxier stick concealer on blemishes, and if I don’t get it on before the sunscreen sets, blending it out can cause a “burn through” effect that is really difficult to repair. Mineral powder foundation needs to be brushed on in a downwards motion and can not be buffed. Cream and gel blushes don’t blend well. Powder products need to be applied with a light hand and built up carefully, and they stick to the sunscreen like glue, making blending tough if you over apply. I would definitely not wear this under event makeup. 

I have no problem with white cast, but I usually buy foundation with the word “ivory” in it, so I’m not the person to ask about that issue. I do, however, burn quickly, and I can attest to the efficacy of this product as a sunscreen. I went on a houseboat during 35°c July heat, and spent the weekend swimming and drinking cocktails on deck (read:forgetting to reapply), and still escaped with no burns.

I decided to throw my primer out because I love this as a primer as well as a sunscreen and tinted moisturizer. I put this on, and cover it with a pressed powder and that&#039;s all I wear on my skin on a regular basis. I don&#039;t know if it was from this sunscreen, but I left Greece with much clearer skin than I traveled there with.

EltaMD is lightweight, matte, no oily but has many white casts and the finish looks not natural, maybe like a make-up product... Australian Botanical is perfect for oily skin.

What a desaster all the way.

Cons:
Tint is a joke.  It left a white cast.
After 15 min., my skin looked and felt dry.
Took me an eternity to wash my face completely from this sunscreen.
I had to scrub so hard to wash away the tint, my face was red and irritated.

54,1893,Australian Gold ,22,Sunscreen,7,195577,Botanical Tinted Sunscreen Mineral Lotion SPF 50,4,"It&#039;s time to update my review for this product.

My first impression was love at first touch. It dries matte and has no shine. It has a silicone-y feel to it, making it feel a lot more like a primer than a sunscreen. It spreads well and the tint is very, very sheer and disappears into my very pale skin. I was pretty sure it was true love.

But here&#039;s where I ran into some trouble. On bare skin it really isn&#039;t at all moisturizing and my foundation just stuck to it and would not blend at all. Not a good look. I found the sunscreen only played well with certain moisturizers underneath, but I didn&#039;t really experiment enough to find a perfect fit. Too moisturizing and it would leave my face almost feeling sticky, too little moisture and my foundation wouldn&#039;t spread. I also noticed the more I wore it, the more I was aware of a filmy feeling it left on my skin. To be honest, the feeling really started to bother me. I also noticed cat hair and little bits of lint were suddenly sticking to my face.

I also found the sunscreen incredibly hard to remove. The most effective method I found is double-cleansing with an oil cleanser followed by a washcloth lathered up with regular cleanser. Even after all that, I&#039;m not totally convinced I got it all.

Would I buy this again? Yes. Not for daily wear, but for a day at the beach this stuff is fantastic. It doesn&#039;t always play well with makeup, and I wouldn&#039;t wear makeup to the beach anyways. The tint does a fairly decent job evening out my skin-tone. The sunscreen is very waterproof, and offers excellent sun protection. The weird filmy feeling seemed to be cumulative. I think wearing it every once in a while would be fine, but it was too much for daily use.


I also bought the Kids version for my kids, and it&#039;s quite similar. I didn&#039;t find the filmy feeling as bad as the tinted version, but it does leave quite a white cast. The kids liked it though, and I was happy knowing their skin was protected.",2018-05-10T14:42:00.000Z,3015769,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3249276.JPG,Peridot07,7,Sensitive,Fair,Cool,Brunette,Wavy,Medium,Hazel,30-35,41
54,1893,Australian Gold ,22,Sunscreen,8,195577,Botanical Tinted Sunscreen Mineral Lotion SPF 50,4,"I have had this sunscreen for a few months. When I first got it, I did not like it at all as it seemed to drying for my older skin and the tint gets on everything, clothes, towels, whatever is in the way. It is definitely not greasy and dries quite matte. It seemed to ball up under make up and while it felt light, it was also slightly sticky. I stuck it in the back of my cabinet thinking it was a no go. A few weeks ago I ran out of my Elta MD tinted that I mix with my Elta MD non-tinted and used this as the tinted one instead and it has been working great. A lot of reviewers have noted that this may not be good for dry skin and I think they are right but mixed with my other sunscreen which is quite hydrating, this works well. I have no breakouts with this and it does kind of blur imperfections with the tint (more so than my Elta MD tinted). I still hate that this transfers all over my clothes and towels if I am not careful and it is a tiny bit tacky but for the price, it is now working great on my dry skin. Also, it is currently easily available at drugstores so that is a big plus.

From reading other reviews, I made sure to really moisturize my skin before putting this on. Thank goodness I did because I found the formula to be very drying.

For one, this already acts as a makeup primer for me. It also works so well with my combination skin as it mattifies the skin a bit. However, I do understand how this could be a bit drying for someone with dry skin.

So it is important to moisturize and make sure your skin is well hydrated.

54,1893,Australian Gold ,22,Sunscreen,15,195577,Botanical Tinted Sunscreen Mineral Lotion SPF 50,5,"I was sceptical because my sensitive skin doesn&#039;t usually go well with &quot;botanical&quot; things. I&#039;m really happy I stumbled upon this though

I have light olive skin, about NC20 in color. I use retinoids to get rid of hyperpigmentation and absolutely need to use sunscreen. I usually go for Korean ones because they often use very advanced, stable, well tolerante physical and chemicals filter. This sunscreen isn&#039;t as chemically advanced, but it has a couple of advantages: it&#039;s cheaper for the amount you get, and it&#039;s an absolutely great primer for makeup. On top of that, I can use this instead of sunscreen + moisturizer + primer - it is a 3-in-1 product for me, which is great when I want to save some time. I have normal-dry skin, and this provides enough moisture for me to not need moisturizer under, and slightly hides any flaking skin (because of the silicon&#039;y consistency, but my skin loves silicones). When I want more moisture, I apply a couple of drops of oil to my skin before this sunscreen; just 2-4 though, or the sunscreen won&#039;t set properly. 

While I can&#039;t say I enjoyed the tint - it&#039;s a little pink/orange on my skin, I cover it up with makeup, which I wear every day. The texture of this sunscreen is quite new to me: whipped, a little thick, but still easy to spread . I can apply +/- two pea sizes, and it still goes on well. I can actually apply A LOT of this, and it will still set perfectly into a natural, satin finish. When makeup is applied on top, this acts like a sticky base: the makeup gets a little harder to spread, but it also lasts longer. That in itself is very valuable to me. Other people might not enjoy this, as it makes the sunscreen VERY difficult to remove - you need a propper makeup remover/oil cleanser. 

For people who don&#039;t wear makeup, i think this might still work, but to be honest, I don&#039;t know that skin tone this would be best for.... It comes out about NC20-25 out of the tube, but is slightly pink on me (I think the physical sunscreen gives it a white cast), but otherwise it doesn&#039;t give much color - much less than a tinted moisturizer. I wish Ulta had testers for this anyway. My slightly sensitive skin likes this, and it might be because there aren&#039;t much botanical ingredients here (they are close to the bottom of the ingredients list), but they might still bother those with very sensitive skin.

I have to apply it over a moisturizer because my skin is very dry, but it doesn’t dry my face out like most zinc oxide sunscreens. The tint is just enough to prevent any white cast and gives my skin a desirable even tone. Because it’s so inexpensive, I apply it generously and can therefore feel confident I’m putting on enough to get proper spf protection. It doesn’t have any noticable odor either, they thankfully don’t add any fragrance to this facial formula. It sets well without any transfer.
Update as of June 22, 2018: I’ve used this on &amp; off but now that it’s no longer winter and my skin isn’t so dry I have been using it more often. I prefer it on my “no makeup” days because a) it doesn’t work well with my choices for my summer foundations and b) I think it looks nice on its own. It soaks right in and doesn’t accumulate in places like my eyebrows or hairline, I haven’t needed to check it after 10-15 and reblend like so many other mineral sunscreens. I’ve also tested it in the pool and it works like a charm - I do reapply it around the 1-1/2 hour mark and haven’t burned. My moxt recent use of this in the pool impressed me because even after an hour I still had sunscreen on my skin, evident on my cotton pad after applying toner...

The pros: (1) it&#039;s cruelty-free; (2) looks very natural both in terms of tint (on my complexion) and in terms of texture. I like my skin to look super dewy so this mattifies more than I&#039;d like but I think for lots of people it&#039;d work really well; (3) it&#039;s not greasy; (4) it&#039;s mineral sunscreen with high SPF so it offers great protection.

Cons: (1) like I said it mattifies just a tiny bit which is more than I want; (2) most importantly, I really can&#039;t stand the feel of silicone...the feeling that if I lightly graze my face that I&#039;ll find sunscreen under my nails...ICK; (3) I feel like I can&#039;t reapply this without first taking off the first application (and I tend to reapply sunscreen religiously throughout the day); (4) I definitely couldn&#039;t apply foundation over this although I think for people who like something that mattifies (assuming the color suits your skintone) they might be really happy with the light coverage this provides.

I am still giving it a high rating because I&#039;m not sure if what I&#039;m looking for actually exists on the market at this point and this has been great compared to other mineral sunscreens I&#039;ve found. You can tell that they put a lot of time and effort into an elegant formulation. I&#039;d love to move to mineral sunscreens but I think I might have to stick with chemical sunscreens. FYI I use ISDIN FotoUltra Age Repair which is also cruelty-free and it absorbs immediately, has SPF50 and also has hyaluronic acid and I apply it every 1.5-2hrs throughout the day and don&#039;t have to wipe or clean my face between reapplications; and it works perfectly under makeup. Major con is it&#039;s very expensive for how fast I go through it (about a bottle a month). So the hunt for the holy grail sunscreen continues.",2017-11-29T06:46:00.000Z,2993975,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3249276.JPG,av315,10,Normal,Fair-Medium,Neutral,Brown,Curly,Coarse,Brown,30-35,56
54,1893,Australian Gold ,22,Sunscreen,15,195577,Botanical Tinted Sunscreen Mineral Lotion SPF 50,4,"This review is for the *tinted* version of the Botanical Sunscreen that is meant for the face. I have also done a separate review of the 5 oz. tube of the non-tinted Botanical Sunscreen. After trying both sunscreens, I can say that the primary differences that I have observed between both versions are the tint, the size of the tube, and the price.   

This tinted face sunscreen comes in a 3 oz tube (89 mL) and is about $12.99 at Ulta.  But Ulta often has buy 1, get 1 half off sales for this sunscreen.  Because of the tint, I do not get white cast that the other non-tinted version gives me.  So that&#039;s a plus for this sunscreen.

I liked that you can easily tell if the sunscreen is new and unused because you have to unscrew the lid/cap of the tube and remove a foiled sticker from the opening of the tube before you can squeeze out the sunscreen.

For active ingredients, this sunscreen has 4% titanium dioxide and 4% zinc oxide. Inactive ingredients are listed at the end of this review. 

This sunscreen makes the following claims (1) provides UVA/UVB and SPF 50 protection, (2) it is non-greasy, (3) water resistant (80 minutes), (4) anti-oxidant rich, (5) hypo allergenic, (6) dermatologist tested, (7) pediatrician tested, (8) reef friendly, (9) not tested on animals, (10) non-nano.

In addition, this sunscreen claims to be free of oxybenzone, PABA, parabens, pthalates, SLS (sulfates), petrolatum, alcohol, dye, oil, and BPA.

There are so many things to like about this sunscreen, especially with the claims that I listed above. When I apply this sunscreen on my face, I don&#039;t get the stinging feeling that I get often when I wear chemical sunscreens. This sunscreen does have a scent but it is not offensive and does dissipate. The lotion is thick and creamy but it is indeed non-greasy and surprisingly (for me) dries quickly to a matte finish. 

However, I don&#039;t believe that this sunscreen provides as much protection as I would expect. 4% titanium oxide and 4% zinc oxide is relatively low for a mineral sunscreen.  Also, I&#039;ve read that when it comes to mineral sunscreens, they are not as protective (from UVA rays) as those sunscreens that are combo mineral-chemical or all chemical.

I like that this sunscreen is not greasy. In fact, it dries on my face extremely matte. In fact, I find it too matte for my combo skin so I need to apply a light moisturizing lotion before applying this sunscreen.  Also, I think this sunscreen is better worn on days when I choose to forego wearing foundation. After letting the sunscreen absorb for 10 to 15 minutes, I tried applying liquid foundation on my skin, the foundation became hard to spread evenly and blend on my face.  In fact, it made my foundation look cakey on certain parts of my face, like around my nose. I think this is largely because of the sunscreen&#039;s mattifying quality - as the sunscreen dries and absorbs into my skin, it feels as if it is &quot;adhering&quot; to my skin (in a way, this is good when swimming, especially amongst the reefs; you don&#039;t want your sunscreen to be washing away so easily if you are swimming).

54,1893,Australian Gold ,22,Sunscreen,6,195577,Botanical Tinted Sunscreen Mineral Lotion SPF 50,4,"This is a very nice sunscreen IF you&#039;re not sensitive to silicones. I will keep this objective for those of you who aren&#039;t.  The problem is my fussy skin type, not this product.  I generally break out from silicone face primers and this product gave me the same result. It looks really nice on if you have light-med complexion as it is tinted, but may leave a bit of white cast for someone who has a deeper skin tone. If you have good skin, you could skip makeup.  It feels velvety and does seem to blur pores and imperfections.  It stays on really well, but it will be difficult to get off your clothes so keep that in mind. I use it on my legs since I can&#039;t put it on my face and I did notice that it didn&#039;t wash out of the shorts I got it on, so keep that in mind. I paid about $14 for it at CVS, which is close to other facial sunscreens from the drugstore like CeraVe and Neutrogena although I think this is superior. It comes in a squeeze tube, which is pretty standard. It&#039;s a really solid product, and a nice innovation from a lower price point, it sadly didn&#039;t work for me.
