359,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,1,73469,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55,3,"This has a nice feel to it. Spreads on nicely, dries pretty quickly, and has a nice light scent. I’ve worn it daily for weeks now - I work outside in the California sun - and I haven’t burnt yet. On hot days it can sweat off which will then leave white streaks on anything your skin touches, but I think most sunscreens do that, so I can’t really fault it there. 

I made the mistake of using it on my face (I had run out of my regular facial sunscreen) and I discovered that this product contains silicones - my face absolutely blew up with closed comedones after I think 2 days of use. So that was fun.  

Overall I like this sunscreen for use on my arms, but will pass for my face and neck as my skin clearly is too much of a delicate flower to handle it. ",2019-06-15T23:20:08.000Z,3055638,thumb/h/145/7_4_1_7_2631187.JPG,silvurgrin,1,Sensitive,Fair-Medium,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Green,36-43,2

359,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,1,73469,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55,1,"Hate this sunscreen...

Only pros I have for this product is the high SPF and scent. The scent is light and fresh. Otherwise, I hate this sunscreen as I have already prefaced. I generally use body sunscreen when I&#039;m going hiking and this makes me want to wash it off the second I put it on. It is opposite of what it claims. It&#039;s not ultra sheer because it gives a white cast when and after applying it. It is not dry touch because it feels sticky and tacky after its been applied. Not lightweight or clean feeling because it just sits on top of your skin. Not fast absorbing because it just feels like a mess.

359,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,4,73469,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55,2,"I kept buying this for a few years when I first realized I needed sun protection, not sun tan lotion. I am NC 30-35, combination skin, tending towards dry, prone to milia and hives. This stung the skin; caused break outs (I generally don&#039;t break out too much), bumpiness, and shine. It was NOT matte. It was not cosmetically elegant. And, if you have the misfortune to sweat, it burns the eyes. One summer, i tried to pass it off to my very pale husband who has great skin and who is bald; he avoided it and started to wear a lot of hats. (We are not beach people and he does wear long sleeves,  so he can get away with this somewhat). 

I transitioned into Ombrelle (white cast, thick texture), Paula&#039;s choice spf 30 (too expensive and somewhat unimpressive);  then Roche posay (tinted for face) and the other one in the big tube for body (the latter of which has to be rubbed in well) ; then the orange  tube of Kiss My face with hydrophasia (no idea what that is, but recently the tubes have gotten much smaller and the price has gone up a bit); and Biore aqua  (inconvenient because you have to order it on Amazon and shipping takes a while).

359,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,3,73469,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55,1,"SENSITIVE SKIN PLZ DO NOT TRY!

I don&#039;t have a sensitive skin but this crap burn me out so bad lol. I could totally feel the burning the second i put it on my face and i don&#039;t know what the heck was happening. Tried it several times and yep still burn! 

2nd problem, it is WHITE. W-H-I-T to the E. This is a very chemical sunscreen rather than physical so leaving white cast is not a wanted effect.

3rd problem: very chemical smell, and the smell barely goes away.

4th problem: Are the scientists behind this blind or am i blind, why they put &quot;lightweight&quot; and &quot;dry-touch&quot; on the packaging when it feels super thick and wet and sticky and shiny on skin??  I can feel it clog my pore as whenever i sweat i can see sweat rolling on my face like rolling on a nylon film LOL , and yes I sweat all the time after putting this on, like literally this blocks out not only sun but also AIR. It doesn&#039;t let my skin breathe :p

I know everyone has personal opinion and I feel bad for this negative review, but honestly, I won&#039;t recommend it to anyone. I have ace-prone skin and i don&#039;t want to give it more burden by wearing this sunscreen all day long.
There are way more better products out there that give you a good protection layer, shine the least without irritating your skin. Try Bioderma Photoderm MAX Aquafluide SPF 50+, Avene Mineral Ultra-Light Hydrating Sunscreen Lotion 50+, Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46  (fewwhh long names!), those r good options for combi-oily + sensitive skin, maybe not the most budget-friendly sunscreens but all r very lightweight, absorb quickly and give you comfortable feeling with necessary ingredients for an optimal protection. I will pay extra money if what i get is a satisfying product.


Please redo a serious research on your product, Neutrogena!",2017-05-19T11:01:00.000Z,2964847,thumb/h/145/7_4_1_7_2631187.JPG,nnma239,4,Combination,Medium,Unknown,Black,Unknown,Unknown,Black,19-24,8

I kept this sunscreen around just in case I ever needed it in a pinch, but let me tell you it&#039;s not even worth it to keep it around for that.

It&#039;s hard to rub in so you have to use a lot. I use sunscreen daily so I would go through this tube quickly I&#039;m sure. The worst part of it for me is how sticky it is and that it NEVER blends in. It&#039;s very white (and I&#039;m already pale) and you can see where I rubbed it in. Not to mention it gets over everything and stains everything.

Just awful. It&#039;s probably an effective spf but it&#039;s not worth it. You can find better sunscreens that are cosmetically elegant and effective. My top 2 favorites for my body are Hawaiian Tropic island sport spf 30 and Banana Boat ultra defense spf 30. Both light and effective. I even like Neutrogena cool face sunscreen.

I don&#039;t burn, tan, or freckle when I use this. However, unlike its claims, it does NOT dry matte on my skin, even if I powder over it, and it feels so gunky that I&#039;ve never even bothered putting BB cream or foundation over it, which I kind of wanted to given the white cast it gives my face. It also stings my skin upon application and leaves little red bumps along my hairline and chin. I wasn&#039;t sure if they were acne (I literally have not had acne in about 15 years) or some other type of sensitivity. Given that the bumps greatly reduced overnight without me doing anything other than ditching this sunscreen, I&#039;m going with an allergy or other skin condition triggered by this product.

359,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,5,73469,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55,2,"Five years or so ago, maybe longer, I used to be obsessed with the Neutrogena Sheer Dry Touch in SPF 30. So I recently started using the SPF 55 thinking it was similar and... It&#039;s not. Either they changed the formulation of all of their dry touch sunscreens, or the higher SPF versions are particularly awful.

This one smells super strong. Not a pleasant scent, but a scent of horrible chemicals. It&#039;s so strong that I get wafts of it throughout the day and it bothers me. It also isn&#039;t lightweight. It&#039;s definitely not the heaviest sunscreen I have used by any stretch, but it feels greasy and filmy enough that I wouldn&#039;t want to use it for an every day purpose. And finally, other reviewers are right when they say it BURNS! My skin IS extra sensitive at times because I use Retin-A, but I have a feeling this stuff would irritate most skin.

I am a soon to be physician assistant and we are currently learning dermatology. We have learned that you really don&#039;t get TOO much additional SPF protection after 30, so I can imagine that simply using the SPF 30 in this brand would be good. Also, with all my knowledge about different sunscreens, I do have to say that this sunscreen is one of the best in terms of its broad spectrum protection and its stability.

However, I am not giving it a higher rating because I only use it on my body and face when I&#039;m at the beach or working in the yard. It works really well at protecting me when I&#039;m out in the sun for an extended period of time. However, I would not wear it on my face if I was going to work, which is what I think it&#039;s being marketed for, given the small size of the tube and the price.

I live in Wisconsin and wear this year-round, but also wore it during a June vacation in California and did not burn.

Unfortunately, it leaves a slight white-cast on my face. For paler Caucasians, it might not matter, but I&#039;m a warm-toned, mid-dark Asian, so it makes me look like I applied foundation that&#039;s slightly too light. It looks even worse after I&#039;ve exercised, since I get red when I&#039;m huffing and puffing, and it makes me look positively sick. I tried putting makeup over it (I only use mineral foundation, though, so I couldn&#039;t try with something else) to see if it could cover up the white-cast since I had originally wanted to wear the sunscreen everyday, but it just made my foundation look powdery and it still didn&#039;t cover up the whiteness. Maybe I should have let the sunscreen sink in longer before applying makeup, I don&#039;t know, I will try that later. Lastly, it has a really strong smell. While most sunscreens smell, their scent usually seems to fade after a few minutes, but this one stuck for longer. In the end, I&#039;m not sure if it lost its scent of if I simply got accustomed to it. Sadly, my family bought the large Costco pack, so we have to use it until its gone.

359,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,6,73469,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55,4,"The main reason I like this sunscreen is it&#039;s &quot;Helioplex&quot; formulation.  This is the best kind of sunsreen (except La Roche-Posey &quot;Anthelios.&quot;) available because:  It maintains it&#039;s screening of the &quot;A&quot; rays which are more damaging than the &quot;B&quot; rays.  The &quot;A: rays penetrate the skin more deeply and cause long term damage (even cancers) that doesn&#039;t show up right away, such as a burn (&quot;B&quot; Rays.)  The damage shows up years sometimes decades after exposure.  We&#039;ve heard the term &quot;broadspectrum&quot; which is suppose to mean sreening against both ray types although their &quot;A&quot; ray potection fades and does so rapidly, unlike their &quot;B&quot; Ray protection.  I think it has a relatively light feel to it (for facial use) a dryish sort of touch, but, it certainly is not the driest/least oily sunsreen I&#039;ve ever used.  I don&#039;t care because it is a superior sunscreen to those which are alcohol based and hence very dry as they contain no emmolients whatsoever.  Neutrogena uses Silica to give this more of a dry touch within the emmolient formula.  I&#039;m not sure &quot;Helioplex&quot; and the superior &quot;A&quot; Ray sceening you get from it can be used within a non-emolient base.  There&#039;s another way of going which you may like better for facial use:  Neutrogena&#039;s &quot;Ultra Sheer Liquid&quot; daily sunblock 1.4 ounces, SPF 70.  This comes in a much smaller bottle and you literally use dops of this for facial skin.  This maybe applied to bare skin and follow with your serum, moisturizer and then makeup.",2012-03-14T11:20:00.000Z,2262327,thumb/h/145/7_4_1_7_2631187.JPG,bernsie,6,Other,Medium,Unknown,Silver,Unknown,Unknown,Hazel,44-55,164
359,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,73469,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55,2,"I have combination skin that tends to be more oily during the summer (I tried this sunblock during the summer), so I was looking for a sunblock with relatively high SPF that was oil-free. This sunblock doesn&#039;t claim to be oil-free, but it was the &quot;Dry-Touch&quot; phrase that caught my attention. 
This sunblock is NOT dry the touch at all! In fact, it made my face extremely oily and shiny, and it felt like a thick layer of goo all over my body (despite its &quot;Ultra Sheer&quot; name). 
The only reason why I&#039;m not rating this 1 lippie is because it stayed put in my swimming pool (it&#039;s supposed to be waterproof), and it protected my skin. Also, it&#039;s supposed to be non-comedogenic (won&#039;t clog pores). It didn&#039;t clog my pores, but then again, I only used this product a handful of times inconsistently, so I wouldn&#039;t know.
But to be honest, I don&#039;t think that this is even worth a trip to the drugstore and the $9.49 price tag.

It burned a little when I first applied but I stupidly ignored this. But later through the day, while my t-zone still got oily, the rest of my face was so dry and scaly that I was shocked. The dryness emphasized lines I didn&#039;t even know I had and made me look years older.

By the time I took it off by the end of the day, I had a red chemical burn on my cheeks near my eyes.  and I swear to go a wrinkle I&#039;ve NEVER EVER seen before emerged under my eyes after using this.  It took 4 days of olive oil treatments before my skin got back to normal.  

I&#039;m using the CVS version now and it&#039;s much better.

359,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,1,73469,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55,4,"I bought this because at 27 I&#039;m worrying about skin damage, I have one sunspot which even with makeup is kinda visible. Even thought I have always been safe in terms of sun saftey, SPF 30 when tanning. I used an SPF 50 primer at one time but it was too greasy and my makeup has some protection. I needed more protection obviously. So I&#039;m starting now, I figured SPF 55 would be the sure thing to protect against harmful rays. I saw that it says Dry Touch and it goes on very matte, I use this on my face so far and a little goes a long way. I then use a primer, I love the way it feels not greasiness, no slickness, totally mattifies. I haven&#039;t broken out or anything and I&#039;ve been using it for two weeks. I hate the way it feels on my hands though, they feel dry and craggly. I wanted to use it on my hands. Well I like that the bottle is small enough to tote around, smells okay. I will repurchase if I run out but I doubt I will since I&#039;m using only on my face at the moment. Spent $12 so it wasn&#039;t too expensive. Only draw back is that its too dry on my hands &amp; I don&#039;t like that feeling, its like I rubbed baby powder on my hands, just has a chalky feeling and that irritates me.

Even though it has a thick texture and can be a little hard to rub in, it leaves my skin with a nice matte finish. It&#039;s not hard to wash off either, most likely since it does not contain a lot of dimethicone. I enjoy using the Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protection Cream SPF 55, but find it very laborious to remove. I&#039;m attending college this fall, and I can&#039;t really afford to spend $35 on one tube of sunscreen and toil away at washing it off every night. I have pretty sensitive skin and this product hasn&#039;t irritated my skin face or broken me out yet. I&#039;ve only tried it for one day, but i&#039;m pretty sure the results won&#039;t change. I paid around $9 for one tube at Target. My bb cream also applies smoothly over this sunscreen. As for the smell, it&#039;s pretty strong, but I honestly don&#039;t mind. I don&#039;t find that this leaves a white cast on my skin. Then again, I am pretty pale. Around NC20.
Update (7/5/2011): I&#039;ve been using this product for less than a week, but I&#039;ve realized that it somewhat irritates my cheeks. The sunscreen leaves them slightly pink. Perhaps if I use it a little more my skin will adjust to the chemicals. I&#039;m still giving this product a five star rating since I believe it is an indispensable product of a proper skincare routine. Rub in in fast and all the way so that your makeup will not pill. I&#039;m going to use this on my hands and neck.

The 55 is just...WHITE STREAKS GALORE. It&#039;s ridiculous how much you have to rub it in, and a few minutes after you think you&#039;ve rubbed it all in . . . Bam, more white marks pop up as it continues to &quot;dry down.&quot; It is incredibly shiny to the point where, if you&#039;re wanting to look matte, you&#039;ll have to blot AND powder and THEN blot some more! (trust me, as someone with oily skin, this is way more hassle than its worth) by the time you &#039;mattify&#039; your skin, it certainly seems like you&#039;ve sacrificed a load of protection, which completely negates the purpose of the sunscreen. I love Neutrogena but they really need to reformulate their sunscreens if they want to be seen as a serious S/S competitor (ALL of them should be photostable, ALL of them should be cosmetically elegant.)
 especially since the brand is one of the highest priced drugstore brands

I don&#039;t like that it was $12 from target and in such a small bottle but after I used it the first time I realized I only need a TINY amount for my whole face. It&#039;s thick and creamy and a little goes a  long way. I always start off with putting it on my cheeks where my skin is the most dry. It was less greasy then the Olay spf 15 but I still had to rub in A LOT and wait for it to dry before I put on my powder. My powder went over it fine and throughout the day I looked at my face and it DID have a dewy sheer glow look going. My skin looked moist. It got the moisture job done, and I struggle with dry skin.

I&#039;ve used the SPF 30 version in the past with no problems, but this just would not fully absorb on me. As mentioned in another review, it has a high rating on the EWG site too. I think a sunscreen should either have a high SPF and absorb or at least be made with more natural ingredients. I&#039;m still on the quest to find a sunscreen that a.) has a high SPF b.) works well under makeup and c.) not high in toxic ingredients. Although I haven&#039;t found the perfect product yet, there are much better options out there than this sunblock. If you want a high SPF and don&#039;t mind one that is water resistant, I recommend Shiseido. For something with a lower SPF that&#039;s good under makeup as well as less toxic than this product, I would use the Olay Complete with SPF 30.",2011-07-02T13:52:00.000Z,2107971,thumb/h/145/7_4_1_7_2631187.JPG,BrigitteBardot,0,Normal,Fair-Medium,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,19-24,299

But it is very unpleasant to wear. It doesn&#039;t feel much different from any other sunscreen, still so greasy that I have to use several blotting sheets to get my skin looking normal. It also seems to highlight the dry patches on my skin, which isn&#039;t cute. And I find that it balls up really easily, leaving white bits all over my arms and legs. 

I&#039;ve also gotten to be really sensitive to chemical sunscreens since I started using them religiously over the past few years, so whenever I use this, it feels like my face is burning. I get the feeling of sunburn immediately upon application. Not fun. So I&#039;ve switched to Josie Maran&#039;s Argan Oil +SPF 40 moisturizer in hopes that my skin will tolerate it better. 

[I&#039;m not on the bandwagon of &quot;chemical sunscreens are BAD!&quot; because the scientific evidence in support of that is lacking and has been dismissed by the Skin Cancer Foundation as well as every doctor I&#039;ve ever asked.

Applying 1/4 tsp on face (to get the rated spf 55) is very difficult. It takes a good few minutes to dry down to clear and it&#039;s easy to get white streaks. It rubs and pills all over the place, enough so that I get worried if I&#039;m getting an even layer of sunscreen on my face. If I try to apply in layers, all of the sunscreen rubs off in very visible white bits!
Rather than feeling &quot;ultra sheer&quot; this may be the heaviest feeling sunscreen I&#039;ve tried in a while... not in an oily way, but I feel suffocated. 
 In comparison, the Neutrogena Waterguard Kids (Canadian market only) feels much lighter, goes on and absorbs really quickly, and *does not pill*.
I will say that it does dry matte. I will attempt to use up on the body but I will not repurchase.

Hasn&#039;t made me break out, hasn&#039;t felt too greasy, hasn&#039;t dried out my skin (which can be on the drier side), and has been a good foundation primer.

Looking for a body sunscreen?
Want to have an unnatural purplish cast all over your body?
Want to have uneven white streaks everywhere that does not absorb?
BUY THIS SUNSCREEN
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I usually buy SPF30 from Neutrogena&#039;s Dry Touch line, have been getting increasingly paranoid about sunscreen and sun damage, so I said I&#039;d try the SPF55. I bought TWO bottles on a BOGO free deal at the local pharmacy. If you want to look like a streaked purplish ghost with ghastly white streaks everywhere - get this! YUCK. Definitely not made with darker skinner divas in mind (I am about an NW47)
&lt;br&gt;
I &#039;m going back to the SPF30. Also, why is this product so expensive for a drugstore product? Five years ago it did not cost as much as it does now - buy online, seriously. Also only 3ounces? Ideally you should put one ounce of sunscreen on every day (especially if you have a lot of skin exposed) which feels impossible, but eh. The lack of strong scent is a plus also it is just a sunscreen - not a moisturizer (which I also like) but YUCK go to the SPF30!

I feel that it&#039;s not very good if you&#039;re going to be out on prolonged exposure to the sun, but it&#039;s a nice sunscreen for everyday.

359,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,2,73469,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55,4,"I only use Neutrogena brand sunblock, so I&#039;m admittedly very biased in my opinion (in addition to not really having other brands to compare).  That said, I think I&#039;m very fair and accurate when I review products.  This particular sunblock has a few downfalls, although it is still excellent overall.   The first thing I appreciate is the cost – if you&#039;re wise in your shopping and look around the drugstore circulars to find where it&#039;s on sale, and you use a manufacturer&#039;s coupon on top of that, you can easily snag this for just under $7 a tube. (I did so yesterday at my local Walgreens!) The consistency I like for the most part; it does feel lightweight and clean, and it&#039;s not sticky or &quot;goopy&quot; whatsoever.  The fragrance (there is fragrance, it&#039;s the last ingredient listed on the label) is actually awesome – I know that may sound strange (especially since I normally avoid any scented facial products like the plague) however,  I LOVE how this lotion smells! It&#039;s hard to describe – kind of a lovely, mild (key word: MILD) floral. If you&#039;ve used this, or have smelled it, then you&#039;ll know what I&#039;m talking about. It doesn&#039;t smell like a typical sunscreen lotion, which is a good thing. (Personally I hate smelling like a pina colada; no thank you!) The standout negative w/this, for me, is the &#039;feel&#039; – specifically on the face.  Whereas my regular facial sunblock (Neutrogena UltraSheer Dry-Touch SPF 100+ w/helioplex, which I HIGHLY recommend for everyday use on the face; it&#039;s utterly fabulous and unbeatable) gives a nice matte, velvety-but-supple finish, this SPF 55 version is somehow not the same. I don&#039;t know whether the actual formulation is to blame, or what. I would think that the same lotion in different SPF values would offer the same basic formulation, just w/varying protection...like I said, I don&#039;t know what it is, but the SPF 55 is definitely different on the face, and not in a good way. I still love using this on my neck, shoulders, arms, and hands (and other exposed areas on days I wear dresses, etc..) so, ultimately, I would still recommend it for use on the entire body (including face, yes, but again it&#039;s not as nice as the 100+).  It won&#039;t make you smell like a coconut, it absorbs beautifully w/out leaving streaks or pastiness,  and it won&#039;t transfer onto your clothing.  But if you&#039;re looking for a perfect daily sunscreen for your FACE, then I strongly advise that you pick up the 100+ version of this, because it&#039;s indeed far superior as far as facial sunblock goes.  Having used both,  that&#039;s the conclusion I&#039;ve come to.  Neutrogena makes great sunblock.

It was nothing like the other &quot;regular&quot; sunscreens I&#039;ve used.With my old ones,I&#039;d &quot;shine&quot; from the moment I applied it,until the time I took it off,it wrecked my make-up everyday,it was embarrassing to say the least.I am already very oily/acne-prone;so needless to say,I hated wearing sunscreen on my face...but I did a lot of tanning when I was in my teens/20&#039;s,and I wanted to avoid any further lines/wrinkles/damage...so I suffered with the oil-slick every day.Neutrogena Dry Touch is WAY different,there is absolutely NO shine when applied,or throughout the day.It does not affect the way that your make-up applies,or wears through the day,it does not &quot;feel heavy&quot;.You will not even know you&#039;re wearing &quot;sunscreen&quot;.I think it may have caused my acne to flare just a small bit the first week or so,but after my skin adjusted...it&#039;s been great ever since,no problems.And with no oil/shine,you can&#039;t beat the fact that you&#039;re also getting a HIGH level of UVA &amp; UVB protection,that&#039;s another thing that you can&#039;t get in just &quot;any/all&quot; sunscreens.So,worth the price,great product!!!! *And just an FYI,yes,like most sunscreens,it can &quot;burn&quot; if it gets into the eyes,so if you&#039;re using it on the face,be careful when applying it,and probably the same rule,if you&#039;re going to be outside sweating/active.*",2010-05-19T04:40:00.000Z,1815855,thumb/h/145/7_4_1_7_2631187.JPG,Kerstyn,0,Very Oily,Fair-Medium,Cool,Brunette,Straight,Medium,Blue,36-43,13

To make it easier to apply, I put clinique moisturizing gel on first, and I mix a drop of liquid foundation with the sunscreen to thin it out.  My face looks a little oily at first, but a few minutes later my skin just looks soft, not oily at all.

-doesn&#039;t feel heavy/greasy
-won&#039;t clog pores
-I&#039;m not prone to break-outs, and this sunscreen has not made me break out
-protects skin from UVA and UVB rays, which is important!
-light scent, not annoying and goes away quickly
-I&#039;ve never tried reapplying in the afternoon; not sure if my face would get oily
-small bottle, easy to dispense
-around $10 CAD for 88ml at Walmart

359,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,1,73469,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55,3,"Update: I have now been using this sunscreen during the summer months and this is what I&#039;m finding.
1. This does run on your clothes and leaves a stain. On some of my clothes this has even bleached it. I wasn&#039;t working out or anything like that but its hot in the summer and you can&#039;t help but sweat a little!
2. It may not leave a whiteish cast on my face to begin with but over time it &quot;balls up&quot;, &quot;gathers&quot; a bit and then you see it. It happened to me today when I had no makeup on. Again I think its from the slight sweating from the heat.
3. It ruins manicures! I don&#039;t know whats in it but when it comes into contact with dry nail polish it wrecks it. It makes my polish bubble and become tacky. Its happened with cheap and expensive nail polish.

So I still like this sunscreen but I&#039;m going to try something else. This isn&#039;t the Holy Grail that I thought it was but still is the best so far.


Love this sunscreen for my body. For a high SPF I find that it spreads reasonably well. Higher SPFs are harder to spread than say a 15 or 30 no matter the brand so I don&#039;t think this one is bad at all. This feels like nothing on the skin. No mess, no shine no big smells. The other problem for me is the price but this is a great sunscreen that works, doesn&#039;t grease you up so it&#039;s worth the money. Even coppertones oil free is greasy. This is the only one that is not.

I have used it on my face because it says you can on the directions of the bottle. I find it mattifies my skin and makes it easier to put on makeup because it&#039;s not a greasy finish. I apply it to my face in sections though and that helps with the smoothing and white cast problem. Don&#039;t know if this causes breakouts because I&#039;m using up another Neutrogena sunscreen for the face that I hate but was expensive. Once that is done I will update.",2010-04-16T00:04:00.000Z,1787550,thumb/h/145/7_4_1_7_2631187.JPG,adara260,1,Acne-prone,Medium,Warm,Brunette,Straight,Medium,Brown,25-29,221

Ocean Potion was the best I&#039;d ever used until this one.  I really like the way this stays matte.  I have very pale skin so the whiteness of the product doesn&#039;t bother me but I could see it being a problem for some people.  I love the way this sunscreen makes my skin look plump, hydrated, smooth and glowy but with no oilyness.  I find that if I&#039;m going out at night I&#039;ll use just a bit of this as a primer under my makeup so that everything stays smooth.  I had been using Retin A and this SPF didn&#039;t even sting even though it&#039;s a chemical-based ss (not even around my eyes!). For people who are having problems with it pilling up, you could try working a small amount into the skin and then add a bit more as you go, working from one section of the face to the other because it *does* set/dry fast.  You really gotta work it into the skin quickly.  This sunscreen leaves my skin looking and feeling SO soft... and it protects my skin from the sun!

It seems that Neutrogena products are a hit or miss - unfortunately, my experience with this sunscreen was the latter.


For reference: I have combination skin - meaning that it is an oil slick on my t-zone/some parts of my cheeks and that it is dry as a desert (ie. flaking) on the rest of my cheeks and top/sides of my forehead


PROS:
- Cost effective.  I got this for around $9 CDN @ Wal-Mart, and it contains 88 ml, which is a lot of product for the price (if you&#039;re using this strictly on your face).
- Photostable! (as noted by the Helioplex marking on the front)
- Fabulous sanitary tube packaging!  The cap is on the bottom so it&#039;s always easy to dispense.
- Does not cause any stinging or irritation for ME.
- My package said &quot;light, fresh scent.&quot;  Very light scent indeed (kind of sunscreen-y, but it fades quickly).


CONS:
- Definitely was NOT &quot;Ultra Sheer&quot; or &quot;Dry Touch&quot; or any of that jazz: made my face incredibly sticky and shiny.  I guess this is supposed to dry matte or something but I left it on for 3 (!) hours and it looked the exact same.
- Thick.  This was quite difficult to spread the recommended 1/4 tsp.  I had to do it in a bunch of layers (I always layer, but I had to do more with this one) which caused another problem...
- Balling!  This &quot;balled&quot; up like crazy when I was layering it and then these little snot-textured pieces would peel off.
- Streaky and whitening.  I thought I applied this well but then I went in my bathroom and noticed white streaky patches EVERYWHERE despite my best efforts.
- Not good with makeup.  I tried powdering over this to no avail.


In conclusion:
May be nice on the body but definitely not for my face.  The search for an affordable, stable but cosmetically elegant sunscreen goes on... *sigh*",2009-12-03T14:42:00.000Z,1675662,thumb/h/145/7_4_1_7_2631187.JPG,krsn89,3,Oily,Medium,Warm,Black,Wavy,Medium,Brown,19-24,46

So I have extremely pale skin and last summer I was working outdoors which created a huge problem for me, because I don&#039;t tan, I just burn. I decided to invest in a &quot;more expensive&quot; sunblock (compared to the banana boat I previously used), because my skin is VERY sensitive and will break out if I&#039;m not careful. 
I bought this sunscreen for my body and I LOVED IT! As far as cream sunblocks go this one is the best I have ever used.  It ended up working so good on my body that I was able to use it as a facial moisturizer for the summer instead of my regular moisturizer! I love that it comes in such high strength&#039;s because I need a lot of protection! I also didn&#039;t find that I had to keep re-applying to be protected. 
I now use a different sunblock for my body because I find the spray sunblocks are a lot more convenient (personally, i prefer aveno&#039;s spray sunblock), but I still use this for my face All summer long and it has never caused a break out or a dry patch! (i have mostly oily skin).
