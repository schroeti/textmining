426,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,2,19626,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF45,4,"This stuff is pretty good in my opinion.

1) Effectiveness: I had a period 2 summers ago where I became really sensitive to electricity and couldn&#039;t stay in my house (long story), so I basically spent an entire summer in the park under blazing hot sun morning to evening (30 degree C +). I applied this product once in the morning at about 7 am and did not usually reapply at all. My skin is fairly light and thin but prone to tanning, not so much burning. I ended up with a deep tan but next to no sunburns. Two years later I note that I have some sun damage on the side of my face that was exposed to more sun, plus some solar keratoses on the side of my face. So, basically the sunscreen didn&#039;t protect completely but it did a fairly good job.

2) Consistency: It is a bit thick and therefore hard to spread and goes on greasy, but the greasiness sinks in fairly quickly so it&#039;s no big deal. IDK if the formula has changed lately because the one I got this year feels thicker. Anyway I mix it with moisturizer to improve spreadability. The sunscreen I found is actually moisturizing on its own so I had no need for moisturizer after using it as far as hydration went.

3) Stinging and breakouts: none whatsoever.

Overall, I am still looking for a more lightweight sunscreen that will do what this does (maybe with a higher SPF), but until I find it this is a pretty good alternative.",2019-05-30T22:43:35.000Z,3054708,thumb/h/145/7_1_7_3_1169021.JPG,erinro,2,Dry,Fair-Medium,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Blue,36-43,20

426,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,2,19626,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF45,1,"If you have dry skin, this may not be for you! First off, let me just say, that I have dry skin. I also use Retin A, which dries my skin out further. This was the worst sunscreen that I&#039;ve ever used. Literally 5-10 minutes after application, dry, flakey, and peely spots/areas would pop up around my mouth and chin, around my nostrils, and high up on my cheeks under my eyes. The only thing decent about this sunscreen is the packaging, which is standard squeeze tube packaging. I actually went through a whole other tube of this and a quarter of a new one. I had to exchange the new tube. Even when I didn&#039;t apply any foundation or concealer, it would dry out my skin. And then on top of that, accumulated dryness after using for 3 or 4 days in a row, would just make my face/skin feel and look like the desert! It is just horrible. This also prevented me from being able to use a lot of different foundations, because I actually thought it was the foundation drying my face out. One tube does last a long while. It did protect my face/skin from any sun/burning etc. It did not cause a white cast after application. It sinks in the skin very well, and it doesn&#039;t feel greasy. It did not cause any breakouts. The price on this is great. I just could not deal with the excessive dryness that it caused. If you have oilier skin, then this may work. I just find it so much easier to buy a sunscreen from a store that I can actually see, feel, test, etc, so I didn&#039;t venture outside of the drugstore. I exchanged this for Aveeno Active Naturals protect + hydrate sunscreen lotion broad spectrum spf 50 for face. It is working very well, so far (*knock on wood*). Like I said, if you naturally have dry skin, this very well may not work. I will never try or use this again, and I just can&#039;t recommend it based on my experience with it.
*EDITED TO ADD*
I highly agree with a previous review that this irritates my eyes very badly! I take precaution when applying around my eyes, but despite being very careful, this burns and irritates my eyes badly! I&#039;ve never had this problem with other sunscreens, like I have had with this one. I even tried applying it with a concealer brush, and a minute later, burning/stinging, redness, and irritation occurs just the same. I would try using relieving eye drops. The drops helped for a split second, but then it just mixed with the sunscreen and made the irritation even worse. My eyes looked horrible.

426,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,19626,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF45,4,Very nice sunscreen. Very nice finish. But sometimes it stings my face a bit. So I&#039;d rather try something else once I run out of this. ,2016-04-16T19:43:00.000Z,2883522,thumb/h/145/7_1_7_3_1169021.JPG,kittycow,0,Combination,Olive,Warm,Red,Wavy,Fine,Green,19-24,36
426,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,2,19626,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF45,2,"  I bought this because the Ultra Sheer SPF 30 has been my go-to drugstore sunscreen for a few years now, so I figured why not bump the SPF up a little bit? Oh no-they are surprisingly dissimilar. The active ingredients are the same four chemical sunscreens, with the percentages tweaked a bit, but the base is different. The SPF 30 is decent cosmetically, leaving a sheen on the face but no white cast. This one is really, really white in a way I&#039;ve never seen from a non-physical sunscreen before. 
  It is really difficult to rub in without leaving streaks. But even when I finally got it to rub in completely, it left a terrible, ghostly blue-white cast.  I caught sight of myself in a mirror under bright store lighting, and I looked ill. The ghostly look does not fade through the day as with other sunscreens. It somehow compounds and gets worse. Really, I could have been in a play about consumption, because by evening time I looked sickly. 
  This may be worth a try if you wear a full face of makeup, but for bare skin days, I just don&#039;t see how it could ever work. ",2016-04-13T08:39:00.000Z,2882637,thumb/h/145/7_1_7_3_1169021.JPG,hannahgrace,2,Dry,Fair,Cool,Red,Curly,Coarse,Green,36-43,18
426,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,19626,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF45,4,"I love this sunscreen and it&#039;s the first thing I apply whenever I get out during the summer mornings. I personally found it to be effective in blocking sun rays, especially around the facial areas. It also makes the face look glowy and soft on application which is why it&#039;s my alternative to make up or maybe for days where I don&#039;t feel like having anything on my face. I personally don&#039;t recommend this to be used as a body lotion though as it takes up a lot of the cream if you were to use it all around your body. Because of this reason, I rank it slightly less than a 5. ",2016-03-11T12:57:00.000Z,2873462,thumb/h/145/7_1_7_3_1169021.JPG,Savvydoll,0,Oily,Medium,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Black,19-24,1
426,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,0,19626,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF45,5,"The fact that this doubles as a primer for foundation due to its texture is the reason I&#039;m giving it 5 stars. It reminds me of the Monistat Chafing Relief Powder Gel, which is awesome stuff. Honestly, it beats out some of the more expensive primers in my stash, like Smashbox Photo Finish, Sephora Smoothing Primer, and MUFE HD Primer. 

I like those, but honestly, the texture of this *WILL* go much further in preventing your foundation from settling into fine lines and wrinkles. It seems to make foundation look a bit softer and almost hazy, like antiaging foundations promise to do. So if you want to see what those foundations are like, just use this under your regular foundation and it will give you the same effect. As usual, just wait 5 minutes for the sunscreen (primer) to settle before you apply foundation.

Of course, the main purpose of this is to protect skin from sun damage and signs of early aging, and it does a really great job of that, too. It&#039;s just nice to know that this serves more than one purpose. So for those of you who (like me) don&#039;t necessarily trust the SPF in foundations or buy the kinds without it, give this a try. I hope you love it as much as I do, because this squeeze tube lasts a really, really long time if you only use it on your face.

Definitely dries to a soft, matte touch-- if you time your moisturizing right. Shower, pat dry, toner (with time to sink in), moisturizer (just a little bit, because this sunscreen is pretty moisturizing, and I let that soak in for at least ten minutes), and THEN I put this on.

Thin layers, a little at a time. If you put too much of it on at once, it&#039;s hard to soak in and it can leave a faint white cast.

It has a very soft, clean smell, but otherwise it isn&#039;t noticeable (and I have horrible allergies, especially to artificial scents). 

I wear it every day (or at least try to!) and it doesn&#039;t break me out.

I was hesitant to try this sunscreen, but what really made me try it was the review on Paula&#039;s Choice (which gives it a stellar review!).

I often find sunscreens smell funny on my face, so that whenever a breeze goes by, I can smell the sunscreen on me, so that I end up never wearing it. This sunscreen has no offensive odour whatsoever.

I also find sunscreens tend to be greasy or heavy - nope, not this one! This one is light and quick to absorb. I do find it has a bit of a moisturizing quality to it, but not enough that I would wear it without moisturizer in the winter. I have yet to try it in the summer when my skin tends to be more oily.

I&#039;d love to wear a higher SPF but I can&#039;t walk around with greasy skin and white bits on my temples and jaw. Would work well for people with less problematic oil production.
 My first ever daily sunscreen, and I need to do some more research. After battling severe, chronic acne from 14-24, I finally found a combined treatment to prevent breakouts. 600mg trimethoprim (300mg AM&amp;PM), .1% differin PM, persagel 10 AM, and mdformulations glycolic cleanser AM&amp;PM. I know - a list of active harsh products. But they keep me clear as I&#039;ve been since childhood. 
Because I am thus so photosensitive I knew I needed an SPF, but my enormously oily skin had me balking at taking the plunge. I liked this, as its comfortable to wear, but it leaves a white cast and it doesn&#039;t play nice at all with my Persagel. It also makes my Tzone grossly greasy, even though I put literally the smallest excess product amount there.

I bought this to go to Costa Rica for two weeks. (I&#039;m in my last three days of my vacation as I type this) As far as keeping me from burning, it does its job, however it definitely is far from sheer or dry to the touch. It feels thick and greasy, so thick and greasy that I can just touch my skin and feel if I&#039;ve missed anywhere applying it. I guess in some aspects that is a good thing, however definitely not what I want to feel on my skin. I have oils that feel better than this stuff. It also collects in lines and crevices on your body. My skin feels GROSS when I use this. To top off this wonderful experience with this product, my face has a burning sensation and I&#039;m breaking out terribly.

Ideally I&#039;d like one without parabens, but this unfortunately has them. Therefore, I keep purchasing and trying different sunscreens but none live up to this one. I have oily skin and this is the most mattifying that I have found. It doesn&#039;t contribute to my oily face. It doesn&#039;t clog my pores. It doesn&#039;t make me break out.

I have stopped using it and haven&#039;t had any new acne, but now I have to find a sunscreen that will work for me.

I don&#039;t have complaints about the feel or function of the sunscreen.  I wouldn&#039;t say it feels &quot;dry,&quot; but it&#039;s not greasy either.  Then again, I&#039;m applying it on very dry skin because of accutane, so someone who has oily skin to begin with may have problems with it.

My skin is very oily and acne/clog prone and I bought this product specifically for facial use. Neutrogena&#039;s Helioplex formulations are stable and some of the more protective options available in the U.S. This looks a bit white and scary while applying but absorbs quickly and dries down clear and quite matte.

The only thing I don&#039;t like about it is that it stings my eyes quite badly, which I suspect is due to the Avobenzene. I don&#039;t like using a ton of products in the morning, which is when I would be applying sunscreen, so I don&#039;t want a separate product just for my eyes. For that reason I will be using up the rest of my tube on my body and continue looking for another facial option. I would repurchase this for body use since it is nice and matte and it&#039;s certainly worth checking out is you are not particularly sensitive. On a side note, I changed the ingredient listing which appears to be from several years ago and includes a less stable formulation.

It does &quot;mattify&quot; itself after about 10 minutes but it&#039;s nowhere near as mattifying as the SPF 30, i still end up looking slightly greasy. 
The sunscreen does tend to puddle around fine lines, i&#039;ve noticed it when i apply under my eyes. 
The biggest con, which isn&#039;t THAT big a deal but still annoying, is how much I have to rub it in. It is really streaky and patchy. 
Other than some really minor cons, this is a good, solid sunscreen. Do I like using it? Not really. But it does the job!",2011-05-28T15:45:00.000Z,2084580,thumb/h/145/7_1_7_3_1169021.JPG,lightsout91,5,Oily,Olive,Not Sure,Black,Other,Other,Brown,19-24,38

426,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,1,19626,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF45,3,"update 5/2011 -- Downgraded this from 5 stars to 3 because it simply cannot hack a day at the pool. I don&#039;t burn very easily, and have never, ever gotten a sunburn on my face when I&#039;ve remembered sunscreen (my nose gets pink from repeated, daily exposure, but the rest of my face is typically fine). 2 hours at the pool with 1 reapplication and I have an intolerably pink face. Great as a daily running around sunscreen, but I&#039;ve used much better SS&#039;s for dedicated outside time, and none have been more than SPF 30. I&#039;ll use this up as a daily summer sunscreen, but will probably hold off on repurchasing on the off chance I can find something that works well both daily and when I&#039;m out in the sun for prolonged periods.

 I&#039;ve been using this for several months as a regular, daily, out-and-about sunscreen, on top of my Origins Brighter By Nature SPF35 moisturizer. I live in the US southeast and, particularly in the summer, need a higher SPF, lest I go through the season with a perpetually red nose. The only other sunscreen I have ever been able to use, comfortably and without eventual greaseface, while going about my normal daily activities, was the Origins Out Smart. Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch reminds me of Out Smart, only you get more product with a higher SPF for less money--and it&#039;s locally available. I love it. I will say that it does make my t-zone a weeeeeee bit shiny, but that&#039;s typically at the end of long day, and after getting innumerable hours of excellent wear out of it. It is slightly mattifying on my mostly normal (oily when aggrivated) skin, though not excessively so. It just has a really nice finish. So nice, in fact, that I usually don&#039;t bother with a tinted moisturizer when I use this, because although it (obviously) does nothing for redness, it just gives such a nice finish that I don&#039;t mind being a bit more pink than normal. I will say, however, that on the rare occasions I have used my TM, it wore normally--no pilling or sliding around. I generally don&#039;t like dedicated sunscreens because they almost always cause a pinchy, red reaction on my very sensitive skin. With this, there is no pinching, no redness, no excessive oiliness, no breakouts. And it just feels nice--like I&#039;ve got nothing on my skin. I&#039;ll definitely repurchase.

So, without any other choices (because it&#039;s winter, and many retailers (and people) think you don&#039;t need sunscreen in the wintertime; believe me, we all do), I last bought the SPF 45. Every day, my eyes are inflamed and irritated, even when I only use this product from under my eyes (but between the eyebrows) down to my chin. My eyes water and itch, and no eyedrops (Systane, for instance) seem to help. Last week, I had a really bad case of conjunctivitis, or a cold in my eye, which took prescription medication to treat. My eyes are still bad, although I seem to be cured of the conjunctivitis. I am going to look for a different manufacturer for sunscreen. This is too bad, because I&#039;ve always believed that Neutrogena is the best skin care manufacturer there is. Maybe so, but I can&#039;t use it.

A problem since I live in a tropical country &amp; go to the gym.

I would recommend testing this product on a small patch of skin before using it regularly on your face, as it seems that while many people tolerate it quite well, others are more sensitive.

It is the only sunscreen I have ever used that did not make my face look like a greasy mess. Not only that, but it contains dimethicone, a common ingredient in many makeup primers, so it dries to a completely smooth and matte finish. So much so that my foundation looks way better applied over this product, rather than directly overtop of my moisturized skin alone. It even prolongs your makeup from &quot;sweating off&quot;, so this stuff is definitely HG for anyone with oily skin. Compared to other high-end sunscreens, it is quite inexpensive (about $14 CAD for 80 mL), and you only need about half the size of a fingertip to cover the whole face. It also works great for a day at the beach when I don&#039;t want to wear makeup overtop. One thing: make sure you blend it well, because a few times when I first started wearing it, I noticed a white cast on certain areas. So, just apply in front of a mirror.

426,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,1,19626,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF45,4,"When it comes to sunscreens its hard for me to find one that will work with my skin and still allow me to wear makeup and not look like I&#039;ve slathered my face in Crisco. I&#039;ve got very oily (non acne prone) skin so adding sunscreen to the list of things (along with makeup etc) that I put on my face can be a disaster, but one that is necessary. (I also need high spf as I am very fair)
While I don&#039;t want to rave about this product and say it&#039;s amazingly great, it is the best I&#039;ve found so far (aka.. still looking but using this in the mean time) to a product that will give me the sunscreen protection I need with out adding more oil and shine to my face. 
It does glide on rather smoothly and dries quickly. But it still leaves that slightly slick feeling on your face that yes, you are wearing sunscreen.
As far as how it wears; I use it underneath my makeup in place of a primer/moisturizer and it does ok if I&#039;m only wearing a light/sheer foundation. Attempting to put on anything full coverage over this product has thus far left me caked looking. It could be me.. I&#039;m still trying to find a happy medium to using this and foundation. If I use it alone with concealer and a mattifying powder over the top to remove the shine it leaves behind it seems to work well and keep in place as long as it doesn&#039;t get rubbed. It claims to be budge proof - but I&#039;ve not found this to be true.
It does have a slight sunscreen smell to it, but not as bad as others I&#039;ve tried.",2010-08-10T12:26:00.000Z,1881637,thumb/h/145/7_1_7_3_1169021.JPG,aphoticandi,1,Oily,Fair,Cool,Brunette,Curly,Medium,Brown,25-29,35

Definitely going to repurchase this product again. My skin felt lovely after applying. This summer I have been using a leftover Almay spf 15 for faces on my body. It gets a little uncomfortable on those especially hot and humid days. I hate my legs feeling greasy. This was matte but my legs felt silky soft. The smell is like baby powder but I only detected it when I first applied. The application is a dream. Unlike some other spray sunblocks it doesn&#039;t have a cooling/menthol sensation. I hate that cooling nonsense. I felt like this adequately protected me from the sun. I wasn&#039;t out all day but I was in direct sunlight for a few hours and didn&#039;t get any color whatsoever. Definitely keep away from faces though! I do wish it weren&#039;t as expensive but it does go on sale regularly.

I couldn&#039;t find this one on MUA so I guess I&quot;ll write my review here. I&#039;ve had tons of sunscreens for the past several years and hated all of them. I&#039;ve tried Hawaiian tropic, banana boat, coppertone, l&#039;oreal, biotherm, umbrella (i think it&#039;s called?) and I recently tried the Clinique and Shisedo one. I hated them all! They all were a thick, white paste that was beyond oily! I have oily skin but dry legs so all of those would make me break out and make my legs super greasy sticky and shiny. This one however, was recommended to me by a friend. I was skeptic because I personally don&#039;t believe in drug store beauty products at all. They seem to only be minimally acceptable if you&#039;re lucky and picked a good one. This sunscreen is incredible!! It&#039;s NEVER greasy. EVER.  It makes your legs have the feeling that you&#039;ve just shaved and it&#039;s super smooth and it&#039;s waterproof and SPF 45 so I know it&#039;s protecting me. Seriously, I use this as my body lotion in the winter sometimes! It feels like you put silk on your body and it doesn&#039;t feel like you have sunscreen on. The smell is tolerable. It does smell like sunscreen which I don&#039;t like, but it&#039;s very subtle and I think they masked it a little with something that smells like herbs or cucumbers...it smells fresh.Best of all, it&#039;s cheap!

I have not found one sunscreen that doesn&#039;t make me shiny. I was really hoping that because it was dry-touch it would have a more matte finish. I guess I will just have to powder my face after the application until a non-shiny suncreen is invented.",2010-04-22T12:08:00.000Z,1792956,thumb/h/145/7_1_7_3_1169021.JPG,jen314,1,Combination,Fair-Medium,Warm,Black,Straight,Coarse,Brown,19-24,20

It also doesn&#039;t make you feel gross and sticky like most cheap sun blocks.  It is a little expensive compared with other drug store brands (especially if you go through a lot of sun block like I do!).  I love that you can also get it in SPF 70-when you look at those charts that tell you who&#039;s at risk for skin cancer I&#039;m right at the top! (Fair skinned, fair haired, lots of moles, burns easily).  I don&#039;t normally use it on my face, because Shiseido&#039;s ultra smooth sun block is my HG of moisturizers, but when I have used Neutrogena sunblock on my face I don&#039;t break out.",2010-04-07T18:19:00.000Z,1780508,thumb/h/145/7_1_7_3_1169021.JPG,loveforsocks,0,Very Oily,Fair,Not Sure,Red,Wavy,Fine,Blue,25-29,117

It doesn&#039;t break me out and provides great sun-protection.
The smell isn&#039;t strong.
It usually prices around $10 so it&#039;s pretty affordable.
Lasts me a long time too.
I was going to buy it again for this summer but the new Neutrogena Dry-Touch Sunblock Liquid came out so I want to try that.

It is not greasy at all and it absorbs quickly into your skin. After it absorbs, it leaves my face very silky and smooth:) It does burn when I rub it onto my eyelids but silly me not reading the warning. To sum this up, this is a good sunscreen.

It does make my eyes water only if I rub it in too close to my eyes but it doesn&#039;t bother me that much. I use the 45 spf. It doesn&#039;t leave a whitish cast, absorbs quickly and leaves a matte finish. I kept touching my skin because it felt almost satiny and  smooth (I think this is from the dimethicone), not oily or greasy at all!!

Doesn&#039;t live a white sheen and I&#039;ve had many pictures taken with a flash and in direct sunlight while wearing this. 

Very afforable (around $7 and lasts quite a while, and I use a good amount every morning) - but then I certainly don&#039;t expect to pay dirt cheap prices for a sunblock from Neutrogena, or for any high quality sunblock for my face for that matter.",2010-02-22T20:15:00.000Z,1742094,thumb/h/145/7_1_7_3_1169021.JPG,sassypants,0,Combination,Fair-Medium,Not Sure,Brunette,Straight,Medium,Brown,25-29,41

This is the only &quot;non-greasy&quot; sunscreen I&#039;ve ever tried that lived up to the name.

It doesn&#039;t have a strong smell, but it smells nice and is waterproof (I&#039;m a swimmer). I would use it just for your face because it&#039;s so expensive and find a cheaper one you can use to cover the rest of your body.",2010-01-25T15:52:00.000Z,1717277,thumb/h/145/7_1_7_3_1169021.JPG,bitternessinmymouth,0,Combination,Tan,Not Sure,Black,Straight,Fine,Brown,19-24,24

On my body,it did a splendid job of protecting.I recently went to Bali for a holiday(its INCREDIBLY HOT there) and I slathered this sunscreen on and I did not get a tan at all.

.
But anyway. It would ALWAYS go into my eyes when I hit the water and make them sting real bad. I&#039;d put it on my cheeks, but somehow it&#039;d go into my eyes. Every single time. Oh and it also stings the rest of my face a bit..not as BAD as the EYES, but still I can feel the sting..esp on my lips.

So I have bad memories of it, but I still buy it and use it (cuz I&#039;m stupid?--maybe)..out of habit.
.
Oh, and I always get a tan when I use it, don&#039;t know if that&#039;s good or bad, maybe sunscreens can&#039;t block out the tanning type rays...but I&#039;m okay with it..unless it&#039;s dangerous? I dunno.

Sunscreens are such a headache, I don&#039;t really wanna think about them too much..cuz u always get updates like OH! This ingredient is cancer-causing! Oh! That ingredient is better than this!

426,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,2,19626,Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF45,3,"UPDATE (7/14/09): I am convinced that my Retin-A using skin was not being protected from the sun while using this sunblock!  For the past couple of months, a few brown spots (from acne) on my cheeks and nose would not go away despite the fact that I was using a prescription spot bleacher, and was using this sunblock religiously.  Weirdly, in the past, my brown spots would go away within a few days after applying a prescription bleaching cream, but lately they had persisted! 

I am now using Shiseido Ultimate Protection Lotion 55+ and within a couple of days my brown spots started to fade.  I STRONGLY SUGGEST USERS OF PRESCRIPTION FACE PRODUCTS LIKE RETIN-A TO MOVE ON TO A STRONGER SUNBLOCK AND/OR ONE WITH PHYSICAL SUNSCREEN, I.E., ZINC OXIDE AND TITANIUM OXIDE.

                             ------------------previous review-----------------
I am a cool beige color in winter and a warm tan color in Summer; I have oily/combo skin; adult hormonal acne (usually connected to menstrual cycle) . 

I&#039;ve been using this for several years and have had good results - not oily feeling, although i do have to pat my face a few times per day.  However, because I use Retin-A, get glycolic peels, and am constantly doing other things to fight my hormonal acne and acne scars, and because I&#039;m finding the morning routine is beginning to take too long: wash (pro activ), tone (pro activ), moisturize (Derma E Hyaluronic Mositurizing Serum), sunblock (Neutrogena Dry Touch 45), primer (Tarte Clean Slate), foundation (MAC Studio Fix), I&#039;m on the search for a sunblock that can work as a primer too.  

After reading about Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protection two days ago, I realized that I had a sample of it last year and really liked it so much that i saved the container.  Well, I located the bottle and found it was the Cream and I used it in late May or early June in Dallas (note, however, the weather was unusually rainy and cool in June 2008, so i&#039;m not sure if i should get the Lotion or the Cream for this summer).  

I plan to get the Shiseido product for my face and neck and continue using the Neutrogena for arms and body.  And on days that I do a prolonged outdoor acitivity, I usually wear the 55 or 75 of Netrogena Dry Touch.  (I recently bought the Dry Touch SPF 85, so i&#039;ll be trying that out soon too.  For outdoor activity, I will either use the neutrogena 85 or the Shiseido 55 PA +++ on my face and still use the 55 or 75 for body).",2009-06-30T13:02:00.000Z,1561450,thumb/h/145/7_1_7_3_1169021.JPG,tthurmond,2,Acne-prone,Tan,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,36-43,19
