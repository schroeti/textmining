It would’ve been nearly perfect without it! Lightweight texture, non-greasy finish, good price- all sought after attributes for acne sufferers who haven’t been able to find a decent sunscreen. However, the cinnamon bark can cause irritation for many people, myself included, which is why a lot of the reviews complain of stinging and burning. Truly a huge disappointment.

92,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,3,151181,Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid- Lotion Sunblock SPF 30,1,"What a terrible product. 
It&#039;s my second sunscreen from Neutrogena, unfortunately again a miss, way worse that the first one.
I used it only one day and there is no way I will apply it again.

Pros: 
- it&#039;s not shiny, even when reapplied 
- it&#039;s invisible 
- it&#039;s dream to apply, liquidy texture makes it spread very easy 

Cons: 
- upon application, it stings (I thought of washing it off, but in about 15 minutes my skin calmed down) 
- in about one - one and half hours of wear my cheek started to itch and some voluminous rashes appeared (I used it only on one side of my face to compare it with my go-to but very drying sunscreen from Etude House) I took Zirtek and reapplied it after 3 hours of wear
- right after reapplying I went out and spent a couple of hours in the park (sunny late afternoon). When I came home I immediately noticed two dark spots (almost parallel wide lines) on my cheek about an inch from my mouth. I do have freckles, especially in summer, but now I also have two dark lines that made out of combined freckles! It looks like I have a dirty face or a bad scarring.  

I&#039;ve never experienced anything like that on my face, I put sunscreen daily... Terrible product! Stay away! ",2017-08-26T23:36:00.000Z,2981056,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,KateLausanne,3,Sensitive,Fair-Medium,Neutral,Brown,Wavy,Fine,Hazel,36-43,621

Thank God I found this, was beginning to give up hope on EVER finding a usable daily sunscreen...
Lost a lippie simply due to the fact that it makes my skin tingle a bit right after putting it on (reaction?) -- although it&#039;s temporary and totally dissipates once the product is set. This also isn&#039;t moisturizing at all, so if you have dryer skin, I suggest putting a LIGHT moisturizer on underneath this. Anyone with combo or oily skin can just use this product on it&#039;s own (and use a good moisturizer at night when you go to sleep to keep your skin balanced).

92,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,7,151181,Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid- Lotion Sunblock SPF 30,4,"Finding a good, usable sunscreen that won&#039;t cause breakouts for oily acne prone skin is not easy. Specially at the drugstore (another one to check out at the drugstore for oily/acne prone skin is Cetaphil derma control pf 30). 
I&#039;ve tried many and this one in particular is an excellent sunscreen for my skin type, losing a lippie only because some potentially irritating extracts where used (cinammon/cedar bark). When I last repurchased though, I noticed that there where 2 different packaging for Clear Face Spf 30, and they had different ingredient listings. In one the cedar/cinnamon bark ingredients where high in the list and in the other near the bottom. If the ingredients are listed according to amount present, definitively go for the latter. 

This comes out of the tube a thin, white lotion. It spreads out well enough for an easy application on face and neck, and dries to a weightless, demi-matte transparent finish. It feels matte, but it has a VERY slight luminosity which is virtually impossible to eliminate from chemical sunscreens anyway. 

This broad spectrum spf comes in spf 30 and spf 55 (spf 55 has the cedar/cinammon bark near top of list) If I&#039;m not mistaken. I have both.  If you have sensitive, or acne prone skin I&#039;d reccomend you definitively buy the SPF 30 version. I found the one with higher spf irritating (stings) and I had to use it up on my neck and chest because I couldn&#039;t tolerate the burning/stinging on my face. I&#039;m wearing the spf 30 version on my face at we &quot;speak&quot; with no problem :) .

I wanted to add that if you have acne prone skin, with a medium to deep skintone, and you cant find chemical sunscreens that dont sting your face, look for sunscreens with a mix of chemical and mineral filters, like Clinique City Block spf 40, or the Cerave Spf 30 with retinol one. If you find one wich is high Zinc mixed with some chemical filters you are golden. Mineral spf tends to have a cast (white/beige/pink/purple casts), but if you look for a mix of chemical and mineral, and tinted versions, this is lessened a lot. 

I find mineral (and mixes) sunscreens clog my pores somewhat around my nose and chin, but on the flip side are not irritating. You will have to experiment with sunscreens to see what ratio of chemical to mineral or which ratio of zinc to titanium dioxide, or plain zinc with oxtinoxate will work for you. To deal with clogged pores using salycilic acid (or other fat soluble acid) daily at night helps, as well as products with niacinamide.

92,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,4,151181,Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid- Lotion Sunblock SPF 30,3,"I went a long time without wearing sunscreen because most of them were too heavy and greasy on my face. Even &quot;dry touch&quot; products felt mask-like and siliconey. Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 30 got a really terrible expert review on Beautypedia, but I felt I had to try it for myself.

This product contains a blend of chemical sunscreens, is a white liquid lotion texture with an inoffensive scent. It does contain some fragrant oils which smell woody to me, but the smell doesn&#039;t linger when the product dries. When first applied, there is a bit of a white cast, but that disappears as the product sinks in and dries.

Of all the sunscreens I&#039;ve tried, this is one of the least greasy ones. However, it does leave a sheen, as most sunscreens do. It actually works really well over other products, such as Paula&#039;s Choice 2% BHA Gel. Those two together are just the right amount of moisture without making me an oil slick. To tone down the shine, I use a mattifier, such as Paula&#039;s Choice Shine Stopper or OC8.

Unfortunately, over time, this sunscreen started to irritate my skin. Now when I try to wear it, it stings when applied. The sting does go away as the product dries, if that is any comfort. I decided to quit wearing it and switched to Paula&#039;s Choice Resist Youth-Extending Clear Skin Hydrator SPF 50. The PC product is also contains broad-spectrum chemical sunscreens, is very light, a tiny bit more moisturizing and is much gentler to my skin.

I rated this Neutrogena product 3 out of 5, because I know it will work for those who have less sensitive skin, and the texture is simply awesome for skin tending toward oily.",2016-04-30T18:51:00.000Z,2887135,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,AshaP,4,Combination,Olive,Neutral,Brown,Curly,Medium,Brown,44-55,155

I have always been cautious what I put on my face and make sure that it&#039;s not something that is going to irritate me but will still protect me.  It&#039;s less than 10 bucks at wall greens.

Consistency is very light and goes on smoothly.  There is no greesy feeling.  I will be a consistent user of this

92,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,4,151181,Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid- Lotion Sunblock SPF 30,5,"I&#039;ve liked a lot of Neutrogena sunscreens I&#039;ve tried, but this is far and away my favorite, and the only one I use now. I use the SPF 30, for some reason the SPF 55 breaks me out. This is a thin lotion texture, not at all thick or greasy. It disappears pretty seamlessly in the skin, you do have to make sure you really work it in or you might have some white patches. I know this sunscreen works great, because I recently went hiking for about six hours, and I came back with a tiny sunburn at the top of my head where I didn&#039;t get the sunscreen, but the rest of my face was not sunburned/tan at all. That is with zero reapplication. I don&#039;t wear daily face makeup so I can&#039;t speak to how this sunscreen performs under that. It doesn&#039;t break me out, disappears well without weird pilling or white cast, and it protects me from the sun, what more could I ask for? Great sunscreen! I&#039;m interested to try Asian sunscreens, but I will always keep a bottle of this around and if it ends up being my holy grail, well I&#039;m pretty darn happy with it. Hope Neutrogena never quits making it. 

Edit: I still love this sunscreen, but wanted to add to say &quot;clear face&quot; is a bit misleading. It definitely doesn&#039;t break me out, but people break out for so many disparate reasons, and chemical sunscreen is definitely a trigger for some people. So if you think this sunscreen is breaking you out, it probably is, and I&#039;d stop using it. At least patch test first! Sunscreen is definitely one of the hardest parts to nail down in a skincare routine.",2016-04-09T11:59:00.000Z,2881640,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,nessyliz,4,Acne-prone,Fair-Medium,Neutral,Brunette,Wavy,Fine,Green,30-35,38

92,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,2,151181,Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid- Lotion Sunblock SPF 30,4,"I normally use the L&#039;Oreal Sublime Sun (now renamed Silky Sheer), however I feel like over time my skin doesn&#039;t act so nice with it. It&#039;s not scientific though, it&#039;s probably due to a lack of sleep. I wanted to try something different, something that didn&#039;t have the alcohol denat as well, to see how it would fare. Would it be as lightweight? As absorbing?

PROS: 3 oz of product, that&#039;s almost double what you get from the L&#039;Oreal and similar filters. I feel like it protects my skin well (maybe even better). I can put on a lot of it and it absorbs pretty damn well, no obvious cast, etc. Not sure about the breakout claim, my breakouts are caused by lack of sleep or simply not cleansing well enough. I rarely get product induced breakouts.

CONS: I think the finish is a bit drier looking/feeling than the L&#039;Oreal one. Makeup doesn&#039;t apply as nice over this than the other one, but these are only things I notice when you compare them. It has a couple of extracts that also aren&#039;t good for the skin, but they are lower in the ingredient list.

OTHER: It calls itself a liquid lotion, and that&#039;s pretty much what it is. It&#039;s not super viscous because it&#039;s not a like liquid, but it&#039;s not thicker like lotions are either. It&#039;s a thinner, liquid like texture, lotion. I think it is an very good texture for sunscreen, it stays in place, but is still thin, not runny

OVERALL: I&#039;ve used this as both as my main sunscreen and as the &quot;I&#039;m not leaving the house&quot; cheap stuff since you get so much of it. I&#039;ve already bought it a couple times.",2015-10-03T15:40:00.000Z,2830294,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,Endit,2,Other,Fair,Neutral,Brown,Other,Medium,Brown,25-29,256
92,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,2,151181,Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid- Lotion Sunblock SPF 30,5,"Hmm, it seems like this product does one thing for some people and the opposite for others.  I have very, very oily skin and this is the only sunscreen I&#039;ve found that doesn&#039;t make me oilier.  Granted, I&#039;ve never used expensive, high end sunscreens.  I did try that Sofina sunscreen that was supposed to be great.  (It wasn&#039;t.)  However, the only drugstore sunscreens I&#039;ve picked out to try are ones that say &quot;ultra sheer&quot; and &quot;non-greasy.&quot;  They&#039;ve all been greasy on me though!  

This sunscreen is kinda thick and has a glue-y consistency, but it absorbs quickly.  It seriously is the only one that hasn&#039;t made me oilier.  No white cast either.  I use it every day and don&#039;t spend any more time in the sun than I have to.  I don&#039;t know if it would protect me from a long day in the sun, but it&#039;s August now and so far in this Texas heat and strong sun, I haven&#039;t noticed my skin getting any darker or any more freckles, so that&#039;s a good thing.  I love this sunscreen.

If you have sensitive or irritated skin, this will sting!  It only happened to me once, though, and everything was making my skin sting that day.

The only thing I can criticize is that there is something about the cap and the way it closes that causes lots of gunky buildup around the cap.  But that&#039;s no big deal to me if the product works well.",2015-08-11T11:14:00.000Z,2816273,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,yvetteq,2,Very Oily,Fair-Medium,Not Sure,Brown,Wavy,Fine,Brown,36-43,17
92,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,1,151181,Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid- Lotion Sunblock SPF 30,3,"The good: It&#039;s fragrance free and doesn&#039;t have any kind of retinol ingredient in it as far as I know, which is good news for your skin! It doesn&#039;t feel greasy once its absorbed on the skin. Skin doesn&#039;t feel too bad with it on. It almost feels like your skin. It absorbs fast! Flash fast!
The bad: It absorbs fast! I usually apply to the bottom of my face, below my eyes, all at once and then apply with another goop on my forehead, but I couldn&#039;t completely cover the bottom of my face with one goop! I had to remember which parts I missed and touch those areas up. It also leaves this weird, residual feel on my fingers. Almost like when you have dried aerosol hairspray on your fingers. After washing my hands, drying them thoroughly, then touching my face again, my face will feel fine, like skin for a few seconds, but then it starts to feel like dried hairspray film again and it feels that way on my fingers, too. Which concerns me. Is it flaking/sloughing off? I don&#039;t really want that in a sunscreen. I used this on a road trip and reapplied every 2 hours, without washing my face first, and at the end of the day I had white spots where the sunscreen collected in the upper corners of my inner eyes near the brow bone. It also burned the first time when I applied it after toning without letting my toner thoroughly dry first. After that I haven&#039;t had a problem. 

Conclusion: I wouldn&#039;t buy this in a perfect world, but I think, for an affordable sunscreen, this is as good as your going to get. I&#039;ve tried so many others and frankly I&#039;m frustrated and might give up for awhile. At least until I&#039;ve used it all up. I just hope the sloughing off doesn&#039;t leave my skin to vulnerable to the sun. I WANT TO LOOK YOUNG FOREVAAAA!!!!

Update: I have a feeling that those who like this sunscreen aren&#039;t using enough.  It does transfer on to your hands if you touch your face. It makes my face look whiter than usual and I&#039;m pretty pale to begin with. If you apply a little in one area, then apply in the adjacent are and overlap with the previously applied area, the previously applied area will rub/flake off in little gross white bits. Make sure to blend really well so you don&#039;t have white spots.

Like others have said, it burned only slightly when I first put it on and still does from time-to-time, but it goes away very quickly. Truly oil and scent-free which are HUGE A+&#039;s in my books. I have very oily skin and if there&#039;s any amount of oil on my skin after moisturizing or throughout the day, this takes care of it.

It comes in a wide range of SPFs and I think it really does an awesome job at protecting my skin. I never burn anyway but I&#039;m trying to be more sun conscious and I had total faith in this product. My only complaint is that, like most of Neutrogena&#039;s products, it&#039;s pretty pricey for a drugstore sunscreen, but so absolutely worth it and lasts SO long.

I love that it leaves your skin with a matte (but not too dry) finish, so it&#039;s easy to use under makeup. I have very combination skin - flaky areas and then very oily areas. If my skin is feeling oily, I&#039;ll use this as my moisturizer or if my skin is feeling dry i&#039;ll use this on top of moisturizer.  I&#039;ve been using it for 2+ months now and it hasn&#039;t broken me out also since starting to use this, my acne marks &amp; dark spots are definitely fading! I spend a lot of time outside walking to work (in NYC) so sun protection is very important.  Highly recommend.  It&#039;s also a reasonable price and you do get a lot. 

I will note that like others have mentioned, sometimes there is a stinging on my face &amp; under my eyes.  It is usually when my face is feeling irritated already though

Update: this has harmful chemicals such as Oxybenzone so I have stopped using it.  I&#039;m using Josie Maran&#039;s SPF 47 moisturizer now, which is not at all similar in texture or finish.

I wanted to try this as I usually use the La Roche Posay Anthelios 50 Mineral Sunscreen Fluid which doesn&#039;t cause pimples, but has a white caste, or the Oasis Beauty SPF 30+ Healthy Family Suncreen (has Shea butter, jojoba oil and zinc oxid), which is good but doesn&#039;t dry to completely matte.

7/2018
Jeez, I have had a love hate relationship with this stuff over the past few years. Had an upped amount of breakouts while using the spf 55 so switched to the SPF 30. That had a better finish but I did notice a correlation between its use and smaller comedones. Also noticed some sun damage for the first time in years. So I tried some other chemical sunscreens like Banana Boat Sheer (way too overfragranced) and two different Walgreens brand (greasy, staining, disgusting). So while I search for a better chemical sunscreen it&#039;s back to the spf 55 version of this. I have been washing it off as soon as the sun goes down and using an aha/bha (both from the Ordinary) to ward off breakouts. 

Update 2018: (2 mths later) I have been keeping a skin care diary for a few months and every time I get a breakout of closed comedones it correlates to this. It&#039;s too bad, because the spf 30 version of this sunscreen has had the best finish (very little white cast, fairly low on greasiness) of all the broad spectrum sunscreens i have tried. 

2018: I realized I was making a mistake by buying and using the SPF 55 version of this for my particular skin type over the past year (pretty sure all the reviews below were for that, or perhaps a mixture of the two). The spf 55 caused a lot of clogging and some breakouts and stinging. After switching to the SPF 30 version, I noticed a sharp decrease in stinging and skin greasiness.

According to skincancer.org, spf 30 sunscreen blocks an estimated 97 percent of uvb rays, while with sunscreen &quot;above SPF 50 (which blocks an estimated 98 percent of UVB rays), the increase in UVB protection is minimal.&quot; 

According to Web MD:
&quot;SPF is not a consumer-friendly number,&quot; says Florida dermatologist James M. Spencer, MD. &quot;It is logical for someone to think that an SPF of 30 is twice as good as an SPF of 15 and so on. But that is not how it works.&quot;

&quot;According to Spencer, an SPF 15 product blocks about 94% of UVB rays; an SPF 30 product blocks 97% of UVB rays; and an SPF 45 product blocks about 98% of rays.&quot;

For all its drawbacks, an extra 1% of protection isn&#039;t worth it for me. I think I found my sweet spot with the SPF 30 version of this product.

Update 2 (summer 2017):
I&#039;d been really taking care of my skin for a few months (cleansing/treating daily) and wearing all-mineral sunscreen all the while (Neutrogena Clear and Pure baby, which is an awful, greasy white mess, but gentle). Anyway, I was getting tired of taking so much time blending in my sunscreen and trying to cover the white cast, so I switched back to this for my face and neck (my eyes can&#039;t handle this stuff so that&#039;s the only place I used the mineral spf instead). In short order, I got clogged pores, blackheads, bumps, and (new this time around) tiny white pimples. The only good thing about this stuff is that it&#039;s pretty easy/fast to rub in the white cast. Also, it&#039;s still a little greasy but now that I use face powder, it&#039;s less of a problem.

Update 1 (winter): Now that the weather has cooled off, i haven&#039;t had any issues with this product getting greasy. i still like how liquidy/fluid it is- it applies quickly and easily. They&#039;ve either changed the formula or i&#039;ve gotten used to the scent.  Can&#039;t give it a top rating because it burns my eyes and eyelids a little. 

--- original review 2014--

I bought this to use on my face and so far I kind of hate it. 

Pros:
- Formula feels light coming out of the tube (it&#039;s a liquidy lotion) 
- Does not leave a noticeable white cast (it is very slight, and the least obvious of the three subscreens i bought this season)

Cons:
- Smells like alcohol
- Leaves me with uncomfortable, low-level burning sensation, as if I&#039;ve applied rubbing alcohol to my face and eyelids
- Dries shiny on skin 
- Gets very greasy. An hour after applying and matte-ing down the shiny finish, I had an oil slick all over my face. It was in moderate weather, and I usually have combo (not excessively oily) skin
- Rubs off easily (see above)

Active Ingredients (all chemical sunscreens):
Avobenzone (2.5%),
Homosalate (5%), 
Octisalate (4%), 
Octocrylene (3%), 
Oxybenzone (4%) ",2014-09-22T01:39:00.000Z,2709034,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,frippery,3,Acne-prone,Fair-Medium,Not Sure,Other,Wavy,Medium,Other,30-35,174

No white cast, but it&#039;s a chemical not mineral active ingredients. 

It is such a frustration...

This is a very matte sunblock-- even slightly powdery-- but I experienced no dryness on my dry-leaning combo skin.  For the past week I&#039;ve used it on its own over moisturizer, under makeup, and on my body.  A small amount of its powdery whiteness collects in fine lines under my eyes and smile lines over the course of the day, but I brush it away without a problem.  It doesn&#039;t undermine my makeup&#039;s longevity and although it claims to not cause breakouts, I cleanse with my Clarisonic nightly just to be safe.  Its viscosity is pretty thin and spreadable-- I&#039;d say it&#039;s comparable to tzatziki dip.
I can&#039;t speak to whether it causes flashback in photos unfortunately.

As you may know, if you are using Retin-a  without any sunscreen on, your face will burn very easily and begin to peel. This sunscreen did a great job of protecting my face from the sun and it also didn&#039;t cause me to break out at all. Also, it&#039;s waterproof which was perfect for when I had swimming practice. It didn&#039;t feel thick on my face and I didn&#039;t look like a mime after applying it. Overall I think this product is great for teenagers with acne prone skin who are looking for a light sunblock that won&#039;t cause their skin to breakout.",2013-07-21T18:03:00.000Z,2526564,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,hannahdiamandis,1,Acne-prone,Fair-Medium,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Hazel,Under 18,2

I have sensitive skin and thought I could use this since it claimed it was oil-free. I know this was to blame since a lot of the pimples were on my neck where I never break out. This product also felt very gritty and oily on my skin hours after application. Maybe I had a reaction to the chemical sunscreen. ,2013-07-18T16:42:00.000Z,2525161,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,bmisuki,3,Acne-prone,Fair-Medium,Warm,Brown,Other,Other,Brown,36-43,2

92,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,1,151181,Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid- Lotion Sunblock SPF 30,5,This has to be one of the best facial sunscreens I have tried. Having both sensitive and somewhat acne prone skin at times I have to be very careful when it comes to choosing a sunscreen. In past I have tried other neutrogena sunscreens but like most sunscreens they leave a greasy feeling and do not sink in. I decided to try this one out after reading all the great reviews and liked the promise of a sunscreen that would not cause any breakouts. I got this for around $10 at my local CVS and I can not see myself using any other sunscreen anytime soon. It has a light liquid consistency and feels like you&#039;ve just applied moisturizer after applying it as it sinks right in without that greasy heavy feeling and also without a noticeable white cast. I was a bit concerned at first because in the past I have only used more natural physical sunscreens and did not know  how a chemical sunscreen would work on my skin but I am happy to report that this did not cause any irritation or break me out. If you are acne prone or concerned about sunscreen breaking you out this is definitely a good one to try.,2013-06-30T16:53:00.000Z,2515844,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,OhsnappitsEm,1,Sensitive,Fair,Cool,Brunette,Straight,Medium,Blue,Under 18,181

I usually use urban decay complexion priming potion but I don&#039;t need it anymore! And it did not break me out, NOT EVEN ONCE!! I used my SPF 50 PIZ BUIN sun cream on my nose and guess what? My nose was extremely oily and the next day I noticed small pimples.

I recently got interested in sunscreen after reading all of these articles about skin aging and damage due to the sun. I just wanted a sunscreen that actually works against UVB/UVA rays and didn&#039;t make me break out. I don&#039;t care if it looks shiny or matte, as long as it doesn&#039;t make my face MORE oily or cause breakouts. I have to say, this sunscreen does the job! I can&#039;t compare it against other ones because this is the first one I&#039;ve used in a while, but it was definitely a satisfactory product. At first, I was hesitant to buy it because of a couple of negative reviews, but I&#039;m really glad I purchased it. I put this on my face after I&#039;ve cleansed, and I wait like ten seconds for it to &quot;soak in&quot;, and I put my moisturizer on right away.

92,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,4,151181,Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid- Lotion Sunblock SPF 30,3,"I have been...not great about using daily SPF, because of my combination-sensitive skin over the years. I&#039;d rather risk the sun than greasy, breakout face. However, I am getting ready to go backpacking (my husband&#039;s idea, not mine! No flat iron!?) for a few weeks and knew I needed to invest in some good sunscreen. I saw in ad for this in Allure and was intrigued.

First impression: AMAZING! This stuff doesn&#039;t feel greasy AT ALL. It absorbs super fast, dries with a matte finish and provides a great base for makeup. I used it in between my Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer (which I also LOVE) and Palladio Wet-Dry Foundation Powder (HG) and it was like it wasn&#039;t even there. No shine, no rolling of other products into little balls on the skin, nothing. There isn&#039;t even that trademark sunblock scent. I&#039;m seriously impressed. It didn&#039;t burn my eyes, although I used sparingly in that delicate area, but it did make them water a little bit, very briefly. I&#039;ve had TMs and lower SPF sunscreens irritate my eyes a whole lot more than this did.

This has made me feel like I can and will finally start wearing sunscreen every day. It&#039;s $10 a bottle, which is pretty fair for this fantastic product and I&#039;m hoping to stock up on an Ulta sale. Assuming it doesn&#039;t cause any skin problems, as it claims it won&#039;t (and if it does, I will update this) I am going to be recommending this to everyone I know!

UPDATE: At home, where I was using this product for a few weeks and very pleased with it, it was spring time (75 - 90 degrees) and the climate is very dry. However, using it in Costa Rica on my trip, where it is the same temperatures but very, very humid (80% humidity and up) I found that this product made my skin feel like it was burning when my face was hot and sweating. It would become so uncomfortable that I would have to wash it off. However, my husband started using it since I couldn&#039;t continue to and he had no such problems. So, the conclusion I can gather from that is that this may be irritating to those with sensitive skin in humid climates. (I am sensitive combination, my husband is oily, as far as skin type.)",2013-04-30T10:11:00.000Z,2484731,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,SHeust,4,Combination,Fair,Warm,Brunette,Wavy,Medium,Green,25-29,676
92,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,4,151181,Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid- Lotion Sunblock SPF 30,3,"I bought this sunscreen because summer is coming, so things are going to get more hot and humid for my skin in the near future. I have normal/oily skin, so I thought this product would suit it well. I like my Olay sunscreen, but it&#039;s pretty moist and dewy.

In terms of performance, Clear Face is pretty good. The texture is smooth and easy to apply, and it quickly sets into a satiny, powdery texture that works well under makeup. It doesn&#039;t smell bad, and it keeps my skin looking matte and clean during the day. I love that it&#039;s broad spectrum.

However, this stuff burns my eyes like nothing else. I have used it on my face about 5 times, and 4 out of those 5, it has burned around my eyes the same way my eyes would burn if I accidentally rubbed them after handling chili peppers. It sucks. It feels like a hot, stinging chemical burn, and the feeling lasts for at least 10 minutes.

I have used other sunscreens on my face, and none have ever done this. I have had reactions to sunscreens on other parts of my body (neck, arms), so maybe I have an allergy problem that most others don&#039;t have. If it weren&#039;t for my skin&#039;s reaction to this product, I&#039;d give it a 5, so I&#039;d still recommend that people try it.",2013-03-30T09:17:00.000Z,2466737,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,BrittaBot,5,Combination,Fair,Unknown,Red,Unknown,Unknown,Blue,30-35,137

a.)  An SPF of at least 30. 
b.)  Has at least 2-3% avobenzone. (This has 2.5%)
c.)  Doesn&#039;t burn. My skin isn&#039;t sensitive - I&#039;m just a Retin-A/glycolic acid user.
d.)  Doesn&#039;t cause eye burn at any time during wear. 
e.)  Is cosmetically elegant.  To me, that means no white cast or sweaty grandpa-looking shine.  It has a nice satin finish.
f.)  Does NOT do that pencil eraser balling up thing when applying makeup afterward.
g.)  Must manage c-f with a huge glob application - in other words, enough to yield the benefits of protection.  &quot;A little goes a long way&quot; does not apply to SPF!

92,308,Neutrogena,22,Sunscreen,5,151181,Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid- Lotion Sunblock SPF 30,5,Ok it’s getting really tiring that I keep coming on to comment on Aveeno’s sunscreen so now I’m switching it up hahaha new brand here I come! Anyway to fill some in Aveeno’s sunscreens all broke me out and I’ve tried another one from Neutrogena back in the day that broke me out too. So lately I’ve been at the point where drugstore sunscreens are a big n-o!! I was ready to go ahead and purchase shiesdo’s sunscreen (which is so expensive for the small size!) I was browsing around on here and found that this had good reviews considering. Still I was really skeptical because this goes for any product - everybody’s skin is different and products react different to different skin types. I’ve had a troubled past with Neutrogena’s facial washes so again really really hesitant and was prepared to breakout but I had to give one more try before buying a higher end sunscreen. So basically took a risk and it resulted in me finally lucking out with an awesome sunscreen!! I can’t go outside without this! Toooo amazing!!! It was like $8 or something close to that and I even went out to get the higher spf for days I need extra protection. Finally a sunscreen that doesn’t break me out and leaves a matte finish and works great under makeup oh and actually is a sunscreen and I don’t burn. I’m glad I didn’t give up on drugstore sunscreens because I ended up saving myself money in the end plus this sunscreen helped clear up my acne (probably the cinnamon bark in it).,2012-11-25T18:40:00.000Z,2400369,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,RoseJade,5,Combination,Olive,Not Sure,Brunette,Wavy,Other,Brown,Under 18,78

I have lost count of how many tubes of this I&#039;ve gone through - summer, winter, USA, Europe - this has been a constant in my skincare routine for my morning workout. But I guess the NY summers are getting the best of me - or the formulation has changed. Because when I wear it in NY during a morning run, it sweats right off in a way that it never did before. I&#039;m keeping my tube for the autumn, but am now on the hunt for something more resistant to wear as this one is unfortunately not cutting it for me anymore. 
_____________________________________________________________

Original review - 

I admit I&#039;m a bit of a hippie when it comes to skincare - whenever possible, I use more natural/organic products and frankly I trust what&#039;s in my kitchen more than what&#039;s in most laboratories. HOWEVER, last year I developed hyper pigmentation on my forehead which I realize now came from using an SS w/ mineral filters that would sweat off my face when I was out running. So this summer, I decided to try a different tactic - back to chemical filters. I picked this up when it was first released (the promise of Clear Face is what drew me in.) 

With that out of the way, I don&#039;t have experience with Japanese SS, but from what I&#039;ve read, this seems to me the closest thing to a Japanese SS on the US market in terms of texture. Its genuinely not oily, VERY easy to apply and soaks in without a trace. In fact, its the only SS I&#039;ve used that makes it easy to apply the correct amount - if not more - because once applied you don&#039;t get that horrid pasty sheen that most SS give. I think I over apply but again, I don&#039;t mind because its traceless. 

I have been using this primarily for running/cycling in the morning - its the only one I&#039;ve found that I can wear exercising outside that either doesn&#039;t sweat off or cause blemishes. (And I sweat - heavily!)  For everyday during the summer, I&#039;ve been using LRP Anthelios Fluide Extreme (the Euro version), because I happen to have 4 bottles but for me, LRP is stickier and harder to work with. It does a great job at protection  (SPF 50 is PPD 38), but I don&#039;t believe its as user friendly as this one is. When I have worn Clear Face under makeup during the day, I do experience a bit of oil breakthrough, but not nearly as much as with LRP or other SS (chemical and physical) that I&#039;ve tried. I also like the fact that it washes off easily w/ cleanser &amp; water, vs needing to do a double cleanse w/ LRP. I love that at night, but don&#039;t have the time in the morning. 

For the record, I have combo skin and have experienced no stinging or burning. But I&#039;ve stopped using chemical exfoliators that might sensitize my skin. 

I&#039;m on my 3rd tube of this (1x SPF30 + 2 x 55), so I feel prepared to review it.  The 30 is drier than the 55, but not by very much (if that helps). For the price, if you can tolerate chemical filters and have oily/combo skin, this really can&#039;t be beat.

Day 1: it blended in my skin like silk, was a nice matte finish, and three hours later it started to get really oily.
Day 2: decided to use it as a primer underneath my makeup, a little while later I noticed some flare-ups and blamed it on my makeup. When I took it off that night my face was RED.
I took a break from it and tested it on my arm before I went to bed, woke up nothing happened. So i applied it like nothing was wrong, I went to work and my face was itching really bad but I didnt want to touch my face making it worse so I went to the bathroom and all these goosebumps came up.

I have very oily skin and this is the first sunscreen I&#039;ve EVER been able to put on my face and it doesn&#039;t feel like I&#039;ve put anything on my face at all.  It soaks in nicely and doesn&#039;t feel greasy, oily, or gross.  It doesn&#039;t cause the grit and nastiness that typically comes with the sunscreens I use on my face.

This is EXACTLY what I&#039;ve been looking for in a sunscreen since I was a kid.

I have not had any of the bad problems that others mentioned.  I didn&#039;t get the burning skin or eyes.  As a rule, I don&#039;t put the sunscreen on too close to the eyes because I&#039;ve had really bad experiences in the past with other sunscreens.",2012-06-06T17:53:00.000Z,2310987,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,EscalatorKid,4,Combination,Fair-Medium,Unknown,Blond,Unknown,Unknown,Green,25-29,59

i saw this sunblock in a magazine and i thought id give it a try because it claimed that it wouldnt cause breakouts plus it was a liquid so it wouldnt feel as heavy. the first time i applied to my face i fell in love with it!! it felt sooo light and it sunk in to my skin really easily. it didnt cause any breakouts either. this product doesnt add too much sheen but it does leave my skin a little dewy which i dont mind since i dont feel it. my only con is that is doesnt apply very smoothly. so i cant easily rub it on my face unless i use a lot. instead i just dot it around my face and gently pat it in. 

if other sunblocks made your face feel gross and heavy try this one!!!! i will definitely repurchase!!",2012-04-02T15:37:00.000Z,2274067,thumb/h/145/0_6_2_9_2247940.JPG,Anniej825,1,Oily,Medium,Warm,Brown,Wavy,Medium,Brown,Under 18,13

No white cast, sinks in quickly and works well as an under-makeup primer. It will NOT moisturize, so I use a generous glob of DDMG underneath and let that sink in before I slather this on my face and chest. This is a chemical screen, so it might sting your skin a little (it does mine, but I&#039;ll live with it). I&#039;ve suddenly started breaking out from products that didn&#039;t bother me in the past, so who knows if this will work well for me in the long-term, but I love it right now. 

EDIT: I have to downgrade my rating on this. After using it for about a year and a half, I had to stop when I started using retinoids and my skin developed sensitivities to some irritating ingredients. I looked it up on Beautypedia and sure enough, there are a couple of irritating plant extracts in it. If your skin doesn&#039;t get irritated very easily, this is still a good option, but it does NOT work well for sensitive-skinned people.

However this stuff was horrible, it had such a STRONG chemical smell.  I can&#039;t comment on how effective it is as a sunscreen, although it should be with the concentration avo and oxybenzone in it but it smells so bad!  I guess because it&#039;s fragrance-free so there&#039;s nothing to mask the smell of the chemicals in it.  

It also &quot;burned&quot; my face quite a bit.  I put it on and a few seconds later my face felt &quot;warm&quot; in a not so good way.
