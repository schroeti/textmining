192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,2,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,5,"I was devastated after Kate Somerville&#039;s Daily Deflector Moisturizer got discontinued because it meant I had to go on the hunt, once again, for one that wouldn&#039;t leave a white residue on my brown skin. I found this one after much research and have bought it twice since then. It&#039;s a little watery before you rub it on, but it&#039;s seeps in perfectly and leaves you just the perfect amount of moisturized.",2019-10-12T01:38:53.000Z,3062153,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,getin2it,2,Dry,Dark,Warm,Brunette,Kinky,Coarse,Brown,25-29,3
192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,5,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,5,"This is a review for the European version. An old faithful, I have used this for years. I think it’s experienced a few reformulations. In the past year it had begun to peel off on my skin when used over some serums and it occasionally caused stinging to my eyes. 

With the recently changed wording making a feature of the ‘Shaka’ bottle that has always existed, the formula is a little tackier, not quite so easy to spread but with the tint, it makes missing anywhere near impossible. It no longer peels and I am so thrilled to experience comfortable eyes again!

I will use this every day so long as the formula continues to be so good.

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,3,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,4,"This is a pretty standard US chemical sunscreen, except in a light, matte formula.  Because it&#039;s a light consistency, it doesn&#039;t spread very far and you have to use a lot to get the proper protection.  The bottle is so small and it&#039;s so expensive that I feel like I have to be frugal with it and that I can&#039;t slather it on properly like other sunscreens.  It feels wonderful on the skin and leaves it feeling silky and smooth.  Minimizes my pores too.  I now primarily use this as a primer, as I&#039;ve found some Japanese sunscreens that are a little more cost-effective.

I found that this one pilled no matter the amount I applied or how long I waited afterward. I also experienced some burning/stinging on my cheeks from it - I believe from the avobenzone. 

If you&#039;re looking for a high SPF sunscreen and don&#039;t need to apply under makeup, this might work for you, but I wouldn&#039;t recommend layering this with other skin care products or makeup.

This is truly a matte satiny finish.  It is very liquidy (similar to Asian Biore SS) and I apply one section at a time.  I have no problems applying 1/4 tsp to my face. It does not irritate.  (I had a major rash from Clinique spf 25 - physical filters only. Also I cannot wear Biore Perfect milk or Ombrelle Faces spf 45 - redness/blotchy)

I have been wearing it daily for a few days.  No clogs. My face appears calm, even toned.  I wear mineral makeup and some concealer with no issues. This sunscreen does not apply dry or chalky or settle into pores/lines.

Website claims Fast-absorbing, matte finish.
Fragance-free. Paraben-free.
Water-resistant. 

I would use an oil based cleanser to remove.

Other LRP SS I have tried:

LRP Hydraphase UV 30 this has a PPD of 8ish and is better suited for dry skin. Moisturizer feel.  I can wear around eyes with no problems.  I will keep this for the winter.
https://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=64949/Hydraphase-UV-SPF-30/La-Roche-Posay/Sunscreen I am using the Cdn version.  Ingredients listed in review.

LRP Anthelios XL comfort cream or melt in cream) - better suited for dry skin and or winter.  Great on my neck and or hands.

LRP Anthelios Mineral - tinted
Tint is too dark unless you have a medium complexion.  Contains only titanium dioxide which offers very little UVA protection.

If you want a tinted mineral sunscreen, I would suggest Paula&#039;s Choice with 12% zinc oxide. (Reviewed)

I am extremely happy that I have tried this and already plan on repurchasing. I have tried many sunscreens and this is the most protective (PPD/UVA) yet cosmetically elegant one I own.",2016-07-18T14:58:00.000Z,2905795,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,autumn95,9,Sensitive,Fair,Not Sure,Blond,Wavy,Medium,Green,44-55,221
192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,19,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,5,"First of all, I&#039;m a black woman and yes black women we still need sun protection! I know it&#039;s hard because a lot of spf&#039;s really look ashy on our skin and it&#039;s a deterrent to buying sunscreen but this goes on light and dries clear. I promise. 

For anyone of any race or skin type this is the best sunscreen I&#039;ve ever tried. It&#039;s easily my HG choice for sun protection. It&#039;s got a high SPF that&#039;s light weight, its a fluid and not a lotion, dries clear with no white cast and wears BEAUTIFULLY under make up. This was tested on sensitive skin so it&#039;s perfect for any skin type. I myself am oily/combination and I have had absolutely no reactions whatsoever to it and I wear it every day. 

It&#039;s a tad annoying having to put the product on the back of my hand first then dab areas of my face and rub in due to the packaging and how the &quot;nozzle&quot; is. I feel pouring it directly into the palm of my hand and then to my face would be a waste of product so I choose to do it the way I described. 

This is great for me since I am trying to fade my dark spots and some slight hyper pigmentation. For some people they will say sitting in the sun will fade your spots as the rest of your skin darkens but the spots darken just like the rest of your skin. They dont really fade. The sun loves hyper pigmentation. Looooves it. So use a sun protection to avoid making your spots darker. 

Price point is fair at $30. For all this does for my skin without any irritation, I&#039;m not complaining. And honestly you don&#039;t need a lot for your face so with daily use this should last you 2-3 months.. I hope they never mess with the ingredients or formula.

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,4,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,3,"I bought this as a last ditch attempt to see if my skin hated all chemical class sunscreens. Unfortunately, the answer is yes, since I had to stop using this after only 2 days due to irritation, BUT if your skin tolerates it, it&#039;s the best feeling sunscreen I&#039;ve ever used for use on bare skin, it felt light and turned to a pleasant powdery finish.

I found my powder foundation disappeared when worn over this unusually quickly though, way faster than over my usual heavier physical sunscreen so I wouldn&#039;t use this under makeup even if it did work for me.",2016-04-17T06:11:00.000Z,2883648,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,Ambystoma,4,Sensitive,Fair,Warm,Brunette,Wavy,Medium,Hazel,36-43,8

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,10,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,4,"This is for the Australian formulation, bought from Priceline. The Australian version may have more physical sunblock than the US version, since I get a rather noticeable white cast even with a thin layer.

Note: before you use this sunscreen, make sure to shake it well.

La Roche Posay meant it when they called this sunscreen &quot;fluid&quot;. It&#039;s fluid, baby. The kind of the fluid that will run all over the back of your hand. It&#039;s very light and spreadable, which is excellent for an even application. It sinks in quickly, even when you use the recommend 1/4 tsp amount. (I measure my sunscreen with a measuring spoon). It has never stung my face.


Finish
It has a true matte finish. The first time I used it on bare skin, it mattified my skin and accentuated some dry flakes. It also balled up the first time.

The second time I moisturised very lightly with cream before application. The sunscreen retained its matte finish but didn&#039;t ball up.

It leaves a lingering white cast on my fair Asian skin, regardless of how little I apply. At any rate, I always apply 1/4 teaspoon (measured with a measuring spoon) whenever I go out of the house. 

Please note that the SPF factor is believed to increase exponentially with amount used.

Scent
No artificial fragrance. I couldn&#039;t detect any other smells. Definitely no typical sunscreen scent.


Suitability for eye area?
It stings if I apply it over my eyelids. LRP also sells a sunscreen specifically for sensitive areas, called &quot;Anthelios XL SPF 50+ Sensitive Areas Stick&quot;.


All in all, the LRP Anthelios XL has a truly elegant formulation. I took one lippie off for the white cast that doesn&#039;t fade on me.

Edit 30/07/2016: I&#039;ve found even more elegantly formulated sunscreens—from Japan! Home of conscientious skin protection, land of innovation in sunblock technology. The two Japanese sunscreens I&#039;ve tried so far are Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++ and Rohto Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Essence SPF50+ PA++++. I prefer the Rohto Skin Aqua (second one).",2016-02-17T06:12:00.000Z,2866779,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,Addy235ZNHrl,11,Acne-prone,Fair,Warm,Black,Straight,Other,Brown,19-24,17

 My friend recommended Avene emulsion spf50 and I absolutely loved it, it was so much better than the Bioderma, left a bit of shine and white cast, but nothing a mineral powder cannot fix. 
I ran out of Avene and went to get a new one, I saw the la Roche posay on the shelf calling my name, I thought why not, got the tinted fluid spf50 and I am absolutely in love with it, it is the sunscreen of sunscreens, so liquidy and light, leaves no grease or white cast, I used it for a whole day on the beach and got no tan nor any breakouts, I applied it only once, I&#039;m too lazy to reapply every 2 hours and still got to texted with it.

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,4,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,4,"I purchased this mainly because I wanted a sunscreen for my face that would not cause break-outs. After looking this up on cosdna.com and seeing that the ingredients passed (on a scale of 0-5, 0 being least likely to cause break-outs, 5 most likely), with one ingredient receiving a &quot;1&quot;, the rest &quot;0&quot;, I decided to try this. 

It&#039;s very light and fluid, absorbs decently, and though it does leave a shine, it&#039;s better comparatively speaking to any other sunscreen I&#039;ve tried. Usually I use a blotting sheet before I leave the house to take care of any extra shine. It&#039;s expensive, $30 for 1.7 ounces unless you get in on sale, so I use this on my face, neck and chest &amp; something else on my body. It has no scent. 

Not sure about the spf 60 rating, since I do notice my cheeks get a bit pink if I wear this to the beach, but it&#039;s better than any other facial sunscreen I&#039;ve ever tried, without the horrible acne I usually get with other sunscreens. I&#039;m happy with it. ",2014-05-20T08:21:00.000Z,2660217,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,rustybag,4,Combination,Fair,Not Sure,Brown,Other,Other,Brown,36-43,253
192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,22,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,5,"While the SPF50 product is pictured, I am reviewing the SPF 60 Facial Sunscreen from LRP.  I actually wanted to purchase the SPF50 Facial one but that doesn&#039;t appear to be sold in Canada.  Here, we also seem to have stringent or different laws for what can and can&#039;t be sold as a sunscreen - many US products (IT CC cream, Tarte CC cream) which carry claims about sun protection cannot or do not carry those same claims here.

So, with all that aside, I LOVE this stuff.  I had been using Kiehl&#039;s and Clarins - similar products with a similar texture and similar levels of protection.  My husband had some pre-cancerous sun damage removed a few years ago. He&#039;d never worn sunscreen because &quot;it&#039;s too greasy&quot; but after a stern telling-off by the dermatologist, he was using something heavy and greasy and was really good about it.  Then he started using my Kiehl&#039;s but lately, to my serious annoyance, he&#039;s just stopped using sunscreen again in the erroneous belief that he only needs it when he&#039;s out golfing!  GRRRRR!  So I picked up a bottle of this for him and made it clear that if he wants to continue living under THIS roof, he&#039;s to use it EVERY day, rain or shine, even if he&#039;s just walking from the house to his car and then from his car to his office!  

What I love about this product is that, like the Kiehl&#039;s and Clarins ones, it is very lightweight - almost like a milk - and doesn&#039;t feel greasy or interfere with my makeup.  And because it&#039;s not greasy, hubby is very good about using it daily without whining!  It has a pleasant scent that I associate with sun lotions and the beach but the smell doesn&#039;t last. It&#039;s all around a great product.",2014-03-13T08:39:00.000Z,2633149,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,mariella99,23,Dry,Fair,Cool,Brown,Wavy,Coarse,Brown,44-55,1477
192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,11,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,4,"First off, I live in Australia where the sun is EXTREMELY harsh and strong. The sun just feels different here. Maybe it&#039;s something to do with the fact we live near the hole in the ozone layer? 

I was on the hunt for a sunscreen that would also work as a make up base underneath my make up. I used the Nivea face veil up until last year when my bottle ran out. Then was gifted the Shiseido one in a gift pack. However I didn&#039;t really like the Shiseido one very much so when I saw the La Roche Posay one in Australia I just had to try it. 

This product does work! We went down to the coast last weekend with over 35 degree Celsius (95F) for the whole weekend. We also spent a lot of time sun bathing on the beach. And out of all the sunscreens we had, this one proved to be most long lasting and the one that actually protected our skin from the harsh sun.

I used this primarily on my face, and it pretty much shielded my face from the strong rays and my face didn&#039;t get too tanned or red after a long day at the beach compared to the rest of my body which I used a different product. 

On the last day, I got a bit lazy and tired of having to reapply greasy sunscreen to the rest of my body, so I used it on my legs, arms and chest and also my face as well. I applied only ONCE in the morning, and again we spent a considerable amount of time on the beach. After we got home, I noticed, the only areas where I didn&#039;t burn were the areas I had the sunscreen on from the morning. I missed areas like my ankles, and that was the only place I got sunburnt. I also spent a little time in the water too. 

I would definitely repurchase this product for next summer (sunscreen expires after 12 months of opening!) and even though it is expensive, I wouldn&#039;t hesitate using it on my body as well as it really does help prevent sun burn. I also bought the stick formula which I carry on my all the time which is handy for touch ups on the face. 

It&#039;s not the best formula and is expensive but I like this product because it does work against the sun!  ",2014-02-05T23:14:00.000Z,2617440,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,rosaschnee,11,Normal,Fair-Medium,Warm,Brown,Straight,Coarse,Brown,25-29,28

There is too much slip such that it slides right off my face. My experience with this brand has been that the cream sunscreens are much better since they adhere to the face and don&#039;t slide or sweat off. I am one wet mess with this but not with the melt-in cream. I find that I still get a lot of pigmentation with this but not with the cream versions. There is very little point of sunscreen if its so light it slides off. For any protection it needs to stay on the face and be able to weather the elements. The only fluid sunscreens I use are Asian brands since they are so far ahead in formulation, I recommend sana and sofina which are very elegant in formulation but don&#039;t have high physical blocker content.

THIS IS THE EXCEPTION!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  It is a little runny so I put a little into my palm, rub my palms together then pat it on all over.  Just a small amount. It settles to a luminous matte sheen which frankly makes my skin look FABULOUS.... with or without makeup.  AND it keeps me hydrated all day without going shiny.  AND there is no stinging! I don&#039;t know how they do it but this is a miracle cream for me.   

I experienced no white sheen but then I use very little of it. 

It is expensive.. I think I paid about USD40 for a 50ml size but it was on special offer so I got 2 bottles for the price of one.  When I run out I will definitely repurchase because it is worth every penny and I hope they never discontinue this!

I don&#039;t usually go out in the sun but as i&#039;d started walking the dog in the morning, I thought I&#039;d better start wearing some sort of sun protection on my face.
I trotted into Boots one day and was having a look in the La Roche Posay section as I use their skincare on a daily basis, i happened to see the Anthelios XL and thought why not give this ago, it was really expensive but seeing as it was such a high SPF and I liked their skincare I thought I&#039;d give it a whirl.
Woke up the next day and shoved some on my face, holy jesus is this stuff oily! I was rubbing it in like a mad woman to try and get rid of the greasy film that was now coating my face.  I massaged it in best and I could and went and walked the dog.  
Came back and I looked in the mirror, I was just a complete mess, I&#039;ve never been so oily in my entire life! 
Now this is the stupid thing I actually carried on using it for about 5 days, I&#039;ve never had a sun cream with such a high SPF so I thought the whole oily situation was pretty normal.
My skin went from pretty spotty, to acne bump alert!
My whole face was covered in bumps and the oil was unbelievable, I looked so bad, even my mum asked what the heck was going on.
I&#039;ve stopped using this for about 2-3 weeks and my face has got so many spots where my pores were just so clogged up and unable to breathe, they are really big and I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ll have a good few acne scars for a while :(
Moral of the story, is to never ever ever use this sun cream again!",2012-09-17T05:40:00.000Z,2367023,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,AlalaGiveMe3Wishes,9,Combination,Fair,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Blue,19-24,2

I use products that make my skin sensitive to the sun (retinols, AHAs, and BHAs) and this really protects my skin from further irritation. I also have noticed that since wearing this, my hyperpigmentation from left over acne scars have faded, while this was not the case when I was using a difference sunscreen before but with the same skincare routine. The formula is very runny, but doesn&#039;t feel greasy or heavy on the skin at all. It is initially very easy to spread then sets to a nice semi-matte finish, not drying my skin out at all. I am also acne prone and this hasn&#039;t caused any breakouts for me after several months of use. My only issue with this SS and hence why I knocked down one lippie is that is leaves a slight white cast on my tan skin, no matter how much I blend. It&#039;s easy to cover with foundation, but on days when I don&#039;t want to wear MU I usually end up looking ghostly.

As for as my freckles, I can&#039;t really tell if my freckles have lessen due to the cucumber/lemon treatment I&#039;m doing. However, I can tell my skin hasn&#039;t tan and it doesn&#039;t clog my pores. That&#039;s a big plus in my book.

Speaking of silicone, I 100% expected the ingredients to break out my very acne-prone skin, but it does not clog me at all!! 
The ONLY drawback is that after a few hours you WILL get the dreaded &quot;PVC sheen&quot; that sunscreens tend to do on your face. It&#039;s that plastic, shiny, greasy look that just screams &quot;look at me, I&#039;ve got an assload of product on my face!&quot; So be aware of if you hate that type of finish. I&#039;m the type of person who doesn&#039;t really mind because I am an absolute oil well with or without product. Just carry some oil blotters and powder and you&#039;re good to go. 
I love this sunscreen, I&#039;m so sad that I didn&#039;t discover it years ago when I was still struggling with finding a good SPF product. LRP is a good, tried-and-true brand.

***Secondly, it makes my face very shiny and oily more than any other sunblock I&#039;ve used.  Shiseido SPF60 sunscreen never gives me that greasy look.  

***Thirdly and most importantly, this sunblock DOES NOT provide enough sun protection.  I got really tanned on my face although I applied very liberally.  I had used shiseido SPF60 liquid verion for years and never got this kind of tan on my face.  Very disappointed.

Now I got back to the anthelios fluide while I was on vacation in south france and there it worked fine (it was a lot warmer and my skin did not need that extra layer of cream). 
I had one or two little pimples but I cannot tell for sure whether or not they were related to the fluide (I guess they were because I am quite sceptical about the contained silicone but this may only be a preconception).

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,3,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,5,"Pros:
- excellent sun protection 
- no breakouts or allergic reactions 
- no shine or greasiness
- very fluid consistency which disappears into the skin quite quickly 
- does not affect my foundation at all

Cons: 
- slight white cast (barely visible on my light skin but probably problematic on darker skin tones)
- very chemical smell
- not suitable for dry skin as it contains alcohol and as the formulation is for combination to oily skin 

Conclusion: 
So far this is my favorite daily sunscreen by far because it&#039;s easy and quick to use, does not wreak havoc on my skin (which lord knows other sunscreens have), or mess up the rest of my makeup no matter what I use. I have noticed it leaves a bit of a white cast but for me that&#039;s no problem because I&#039;m very pale as it is. I have also noticed that I tan even slower than I normally would when I use this but to me that&#039;s a positive point actually because it means it really works. I deffinitely recommend this for anyone with oily / combination skin.

It is not cosmetically elegant at all. I used this ss over a light moisturizer [cetaphil] and then put my foundation &amp; powder on. It doesn&#039;t do well with makeup. Maybe if worn just alone it would be ok, but I don&#039;t leave the house w/out makeup on - my skin isn&#039;t that perfect [yet!!!]. I wore this product all last summer while outside babysitting for hours upon hours &amp; didn&#039;t get sunburned, so that&#039;s a plus - I was also wearing a giant hat, which helps. I think this ss does work to protect you against the sun, it just isn&#039;t good for combination or oily skin. It may have contributed to some pimples &amp; blackheads/clogged pores as well.

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,6,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,1,"I live in Singapore which is famous for its hot and humid weather. Thus, I use sunblock daily and always on the hunt for new ones. Most of the time, I would purchase Japanese sunblock because they tend to be absorbed better and leave a matte finish. However, I would occasionally try European sunblocks for the fun of it.

Anyway, I received this sample from a magazine and since it was free, I decided to try it one day when I had to work for 4hrs under the scorching hot sun. 

Upon application, it felt heavy and thick on my skin. After half an hour, my skin felt like it couldn&#039;t breathe but I refuse to wash it off. In the end, it made my face so greasy! Normally, my skin type is normal/dry and my face hardly perspires so this one was really shocking to me. 
Although I didn&#039;t have any breakouts, sunburnt or a tan, there are other better and cheaper drugstore products that are not as greasly. Besides, the point of having a sunblock is that people will be going out under the hot sun which means they will perspire so it doesn&#039;t make sense to snap on such a greasy product. 

Lastly, the main selling point of this product is its ridiculously high PPD rating of 20 and above. Please do not be fooled by the PPD rating because you do not need such a high rating. PPD of 8 and above is more than sufficient. This goes for SPF too. Anything that is higher than SPF 50 only offers you about 0.2 percent of additional protection. Btw, the higher the PPD and SPF rating, the greater the possibility of it clogging your pores. Thus, why should you want to use a product that has such high PPD and SPF rating, clog your pores just for the additional 0.2 percent(approx) protection?

According to an article, an SPF 50 and PPD of  8 is more than sufficient so please, please, please don&#039;t be fooled by La Roche Posay&#039;s marketing scheme of high UVA and UVB protection.

Finding a good sun screen has been a never-ending chore for me. My biggest problems with sun screens in general are always 1) leaves a white-cast on my face (must be my yellow/olive skin tone), 2) makes my face look greasy, 3) makes me break out, and 4) not high enough PPD.  I feel this sun screen adequately (not perfectly but that&#039;s too much to ask) addresses all of the above concerns.

I do not find it oily and I have combination skin. I will concede that this is NOT a matt sunscreen either. But it sinks in well and quickly for me, unlike some other sunscreens I have purchased. For some reason the Canadian La Roche Posay sunscreens all seem so stickey and oily.  I find it strange how the same brand can produce such a superior product in Europe, and why they don&#039;t make the same product in Canada too?  I highly recomment fluide extreme.

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,2,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,4,"I think this sunscreen may be my HG. However it is too early to tell because I just switched back to it since my experience with Avene Cleanance Solaire Spf 40. My first experience with this sunscreen was &quot;okay&quot;. I bought it this past summer because I wanted something with a high ppd, photo-stability factor, and a fluid like texture, something in a texture along the lines of a Japanese ss. This fulfilled most of my expectations. The texture is like a Japanese ss but not as matte and it is less oily than the other LRP ss I&#039;ve tried. As with most LRP ss in my experience, it&#039;s best to use a serum moisturizer than a cream to prevent balling. It also has a good ppd of 28. But after continued usage for two months, it broke me out worse than I would get without using this (the cystic acne got a little nastier looking). So I decided to stop and switch to Avene. Avene is great too but it&#039;s sticky. So here I am, switched back to LRP. If I update and edit with cons then this ss is not my HG and I think I will try Avene Emulsion Spf 50.

EDIT* 3/21/09
I used this ss for three months straight and there were no signs of breakouts. I didn&#039;t exfoliate when I initially used this in but I do now. I have less clogged pores and I&#039;m also on differin 0.3% which is probably why I don&#039;t break out as much. Any way, this holds HG status for me.

I love La Roche Posay brand, because it is recommended by many magazines ad dermatologists as the sunscreen with the broadest spectrum coverage.  I really don&#039;t like to waste too much money on skincare and makeup in general but would splurge on sunscreen, because it is the perhaps the most important step in wrinkle-prevention and anti-aging.

I have oily/combo skin and I use this without much problem. On top of this I wear my usual makeup. By mid-day I do get a bit oily but I dont mind blotting since I always feel happy knowing that the PPD in this is 28 which is much higher than my other favorite Shiseido Lotion SPF55. 
I like the protection this provides. It is important to use a oil-based cleanser to remove all the sunscreen off your face.

Shiseido causes zero oilies on me but provides lesser UVA protection.

It is photostable and I find it protects my skin very well from any color change.  It is also slightly moisturizing (which I like). 


 My only complaint is that it takes awhile to rub in entirely and there is somewhat of a white caste (that more or less disappears after awhile).  


The cost is reasonable in my estimation considering the effectiveness of the product (approximately $25 canadian).  Up until recently its been hard to find LRP in the US but I know that CVS has just started carrying it (at least in NYC but I&#039;m hoping for all you other ladies that it is more widespread).


If your really looking to protect yourself from both UVA and UVB rays, this is a good product for you.  As I entered my 40s, I became quite serious about skincare and this is one of my HGs (including LRP lait 45 and Sofina lucent).  Just fyi, for my body, I love ombrelle which is also photostable.

It may be an effective sunscreen but it dried out my skin way too much. 
sunscreens will make you look greasy no matter what! The key word is &quot;look.&quot;  So if you don&#039;t wear foundation and/ or powder.  you will have a shiny sheath on your face.  I have combo dry/ oily tzone skin.  I find the high content of alcohol in this product drying (that is why it is made for oily skin) so I use it with a moisturizing physical block like titanium or a reg. moisturizer depending on the protection needed each day.  No matter how dry your skin, this product will make you look  greasy but it doesn&#039;t mean that it is moisturizing.  I use this on days where I over moisturized my face on the previous night, pms oilies or super humid days because when I take it off, my skin is not very hydrated or supple as it shouldn&#039;t be since it is formulated for oily skin.  I use the cream version when I am dry without a moisturizer and under my foundation and loose powder.  As far as efficacy, the cream seems to have better protection and doesn&#039;t wear off as quickly in water. My fiance and I went to the beach.  He wore the cream and didn&#039;t reapply all day.  I wore this, reapplied it after each swim and stayed under an umbrella and sunhat while on land.  I got a tan in the two 40 minute periods that I was in the ocean.  He didn&#039;t get any color wearing the cream.  He didn&#039;t put anything on his shoulders and chest and burnt to a crisp.  He is fairer than me so I would assume that the cream is more effective for at least water resistance.  The cream seems to absorb better into the skin and is a great makeup primer as I have discovered while looking for a primer for my wedding day next month.  Definitely more effective than regular physical blocks.  I am so glad that I found a chemical block that my skin will finally tolerate because my melasma got darker in the years I just used a physical block.  I sincerely believe that both chemical and physcial blocks are required.",2008-08-14T09:53:00.000Z,1316465,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,gurululu,7,Very Dry,Fair,Not Sure,Brown,Other,Other,Green,36-43,159

I bought this on eBay because the FDA will only approve La Roche Posay in SPF 15 (at the time I purchased this), which is too low for me.  I wanted to love this; I wanted it to be a HG sunscreen, but oh is it greasy.  I have to blot it before I can put makeup over it, and even then the makeup won&#039;t sit properly on top because it beads/rubs off very easily.

I was rotating Banana Boat&#039;s Sunwear and Neutrogena&#039;s Dry Touch but wasn&#039;t truly happy with either.  Both stung my face, had weird greasy finishes, and I&#039;d get clogged pores from the Neutrogena, but for the high PPD and photostable formulations available at any Target, I put up with it.  Then in February, I went to Mexico and bought LRP&#039;s Anthelios XL Fluide Extreme SPF 60.  This product has completely changed all my pre/misconceptions about a truly broad sprectrum facial sunscreen: it dries to a nice, non-greasy finish- great for under makeup- but doesn&#039;t dry out my skin, absolutely no stinging, and doesn&#039;t clog pores.  The product is very lightweight and doesn&#039;t feel heavy or oily on my combination skin.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The downside for me is the packaging, price, and availability.  You *must* screw the cap on tightly after every use - god forbid you do what I did - which is just put the cap on and the sunscreen got all over my counter.  (But hey, the packaging is also small and easy for travel.)  The price is outrageous, like $30+ and you have to buy it online which is a pain.

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,2,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,4,"I&#039;ve been using this for about a month after reading that Mexoryl is a broad spectrum sunscreen which protects against UVA and UVB.  The high protection of SPF 60 rang an alarm in my head, because I&#039;m allergic to a certain ingredients in sunscreen and usually something higher than 30 smells trouble to me, even those labeled &quot;for sensitive skin&quot; such as Neutrogena Dry Touch.  I get rashes all over.  The only SPF 50 protection I&#039;m ok with so far was the Bioderma.  To be cautious, I stopped by the store twice to try it out.  I didn&#039;t believe it the first time I didn&#039;t come home with a bad reaction.  I thought that was because I didn&#039;g apply enough.  So I went went back the 2nd time and this time applied more products on my arm.  I was pleasantly surprise to find that my skin was completely ok with that!  Hooray.

I went ahead and bought the fluid extreme.  I&#039;m happy with the sun protection.  I was on vacation twice using this everyday.  Once in August in Rome - extremely warm with intense heat - for 1 week.  With its excellent UVA and UVB protection.  I came home neither with burn nor much darker skin!  As a sunscreen backed with scientific proof and recommendations from dermatologist, I trust that this is a good product.

The reason why it is a 4.  I have very oily skin, If you care much about how you look (measured in terms of shininess) then this is perhaps not the right product for you.  If I do not blot regularly, a few hours later my face is s-h-i-n-y, the clear greasy film is so obvious from the mirror.  Alone with tissue paper I could see how much of grasiness I got on the tissue paper!  I have to have a tissue or blotting paper with me at all times when using this sunscreen.  Not surprising knowing the Mexoryl XL is not a water-soluble chemical.  

Well, so far I&#039;ll still keep buying it, mostly because the product offers great protection and there&#039;s only that many sunscreen with high protection that my skin doesn&#039;t protest against.  When using this I blot regularly and apply powder on my face.  Will keep using it until I find something that I can rate 5.

This review is for the SPF 50+ (Summer 2008) 


Well after a month using this is about time I review this fantastic Sunscreen. I didnt want to  at first because I wanted to make sure it didn&#039;t brake me out as some other have done previously and my skin could tolerate such high SPF and PPD. On that part I am delighted which I am very pleased. Because a good sunscreen that my skin and I like is almost impsossible to find, kid you not. I am very picky when it comes to Skincare, specially Sunscreens.




Another reason I like this is because I like to buy my products as much as I can in the store or Chemist and try samples if I can before buying. So even though I have slightly Dry Skin I much preffer the Fluid than the Cream. (Creams in my skin feel sufocating, greasy and generaly tacky as well as impossible to use MU on top) another plus is that is FRAGANCE FREE. 



Now the texture: This is in the same league as L&#039;Oreal Matte Fluid SPF 50+ Anti Wrinkle and Brown Spot (PPD20) only that the PPD of this is 28 (you pay for that too but it doesn&#039;t matter). Also I can compare this to Sofina Lucent that I &amp;#9829; for Winter (PPD8) but LRP is not that elegant as this is a tiny bit more shiny than Sofina but not as shiny as L&#039;Oreal , also it has better finish than DiorSnow PA+++ because DiorSnow leaves a white cast (they call that skin whitening which is not and that has a 30 ml Bottle which makes this ridicolous and expensive if appled correctly - 1/4 tea spoon for the face and 1/4 tea spoon for the neck)


The trick of using this is also remove it with an Oil Cleanser as this is waterpoof to fully cleanse the face &amp; neck) and spread it well as the texture is a bit runny (feels like almost like an Oily water)  and needs some atention to get the whole face well covered and protected.


I will buy this again and again for Spring and Summer because it&#039;s easy for me to find, elegant (as much as a Sunscreen can be) I can use Make Up on top after let it dry for 10 15 mintes  and it&#039;s wonderful although a but shiny but I rather deal with shiny than grease or white film /cast. I just can&#039;t use Cream in Sunscreen because they leave my face very shiny and greasy.



From all the Sunscreens I have tried this is all around the best considering the fantastic protection this offers and the bottle is a 50 ml. which is great. I highly recomend this to anyone that needs a good protection, if in a sunny country has to be appled twice daily.

Skin Type: Baumann - Dry Resistant Wrinkled and Pigmented. Slightly Dry in Winter no acne prone and usually problem free.

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,0,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,3,"I have used this for 2 years now having purchased it from an ebay seller in Ireland (for some reason you cannot get it in the U.K). It cost me £18 per bottle. 

My skin problem is that although I have an olive complexion, my skin is thin/translucent. You can see veins, but more important in relation to this review, I have a smattering of sun spots (solar lentigines) that look like freckles all over the tops of my cheeks and across my nose. I also have sun and heat sensitivity and get very irritated by both and my facial skin burns, even with recent application of sunscreen, if I do not also wear a hat.

Positives: This is a lotion contains what is claimed to be the most advanced UVA and UVB chemical sunscreen ingredient that does not breakdown as readily as others. Application is easy and with SPF 60 you can be assured of the highest level of sun protection. No white cast, but that is because this is a chemical, not a mineral screen. However, this was a big plus point as I have an olive complexion. It did stop me getting tanned over the summer. I spend a lot of time outdoors. 

Negatives: On my skin it leaves a film of oil that takes an hour to sink in and does not disperse fully. It is a strong chemical which is obvious once you apply it from the smell and the way skin responds. It caused me more blackheads then ever before (I&#039;m 43 so they are not the result of teenage hormones!) and constant irritation of the eyes even though I never apply it, or any other sun protection, beyond my cheekbones. The irritation increased after exposure to the sun and I had no eye irritation on days I did not used this (I was sick, in bed, in a dark room), so it is definitely this product that caused it. Also, it did not stop new sunspots appearing. I noticed a particularly clownish one appearing on the very tip of my nose despite frequent daily application of this product.

I am now in the process of testing other sunscreens on my face, both mineral and chemical as well as trying out mineral make-up. ",2008-04-26T04:43:00.000Z,1240871,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,similittleone,0,Acne-prone,Olive,Unknown,Other,Unknown,Unknown,Black,36-43,4

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,3,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,5,"After have been a big fan of Clarins UV Plus for several years I think I have found my HG sunscreen. Clarins has changed their packaging and claims that the new formula (HP) is included E3P which can protect your skin from Electromagnetic Waves and increase the price to 70SGD for 30ml bottle (from 50+ SGD) hence I thought I have to find the more reasonable price one. One fine shopping day I just strolled around the drugstore and bump into this LP FluidExtreme SPF 50+ once I tried on my arm I said “wow.. this is pretty much like clarins..” and the ingredient is far better (in terms of the capability of protecting from strong sun, no fragrance, less bad ingredients) so I decided to give it a try.

The texture is very light, absorbed quickly and not greasy but it does leave a very little shiny effect on your face (I mean it isn’t oily but the texture doesn’t make your face totally matte… to be compared: clarins is more matte) which I prefer. No white cast (which I always concern on any sunblock lotion – I’m tan) I have normal to dry skin but always put on quite a fair amount of moisturizer beforehand (that&#039;s why I don&#039;t get the cream version as after moiturizer - makeup base - foundation.. I think I can fry bacons on my face..it will be too oily) and LP doesn’t make my face slick at all. Talk about an ability of protection it is combined between physical and chemical active agent (titanium dioxide and Mexoryl SX and XL filters ) which is better than clarins (Clarins use micro-fined titanium dioxide which is not very stable for very strong sun light in longer hours) and SPF50+ with PPD 28 is the plus. (UVA is my main concern)

After I tried this LP baby I told myself I need Clarins no more..!! LP is better, cheaper (got it for 41SGD for 50ml bottle) if you’re not sensitive to chemical sunscreen, go and grab it..!!

I have maturing, normal/dry/acne prone skin (very oily/acne prone in youth,) and the texture of this product is wonderful, comparable to Clarins UV block, milky and slightly greasy, as some reviewers have previously mentioned.  This did not aggravate my acne either and was nice under makeup.  All that being said, I cannot use this product--for some reason, the two ss I have used containing the chemical mexoryl (the other one was by Loreal) have given me some sort of skin reaction.  It&#039;s strange because I do not get the reaction using Neutrogena&#039;s helioplex (sp?) ingredient, just the mexoryl.  It&#039;s also a shame becaue I want the highest spf protection, but for now, I will stick to the Dermalogica Super Sensitive spf 30 (nice because of its antioxidants and whitening ingredients of licorice and kojic acid) and Clarins UV w/white tea.

No white cast.  No thickness.  Even if you have Bettie Page bangs, you&#039;re all set - there is no stickiness whatsoever.

So, why is this sunscreen not my Holy Grail, and why won&#039;t I repurchase again?  I tried to make it work.  Even if I completely avoid the eye area, my eyes go red, sting, and tear throughout the day until I wash my face that night.  My nose runs and I look like I&#039;ve got a cold - it literally ruins my day, and all I can think about is running home to wash it off.  Not only that, wearing this particular SPF 50+ Fluide Extreme sunscreen is too intense for my skin and causes a great deal of peeling if I am heavily into advanced skincare (Retin-A, low-pH glycolic acid, Ferulic); so if I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; wear this SPF, it is only in the summertime when I&#039;m taking time off this regime &amp; it&#039;s just about self-tanning.

This really is a shame, because the sunscreen itself is otherwise perfect in every way!!

This one strangely was less greasy, much more fluid than the spf 40 one. Left my face soft, smooth and protected safely against the sun. It&#039;s a decent sunscreen with both UVA and UVB protection, with physical and chemical filters for a broad range of protection. It didn&#039;t gave me any breakouts too and it was pretty easy to remove off at the end of the day. Love this sunscreen loads!

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,1,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,5,"A very elegant Mexoryl containing sunscreen option for oily skin. This is a very watery fluid sunscreen that applies easily over other products/ moisturizers without feeling heavy. It does impart some shine, but more of a silcone-y sort than greasy-looking and I find it very tolerable. It has extremely high spf/ ppd protection and comes in a very tiny, portable bottle that fits well in a purse or pocket, making reapplication on the go easy. The only real difficulty I have is knowing how much product to apply. All sunscreen labels tend to fall back on the old &quot;apply liberally&quot; standard, but I can&#039;t help thinking that a smaller amount of this sunblock would be required, since it doesn&#039;t have as much of an emollient base or other fillers. Still, I&#039;m reluctant to risk applying too little, so I think I&#039;m going to go through the tiny 50 ml. bottle within a few weeks, making this product prohibitively expensive. So, despite my LOVE of this product, I might stick to the lotion version (lait).",2007-10-03T13:14:00.000Z,1087357,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,kerewin,1,Combination,Other,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Green,36-43,13
192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,16,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,2,"I have fair skin that has been known to burn in the rain and is sensitive and photosensitive, producing spectacular blotchy hives at the literal drop of a hat. It also reacts to non-physical UV blockers with amusing breakouts. I have been wearing sunscreens of one sort or another for decades; usually one for the face and one for the rest of the delectable self. My current tipple of choice for the face is the Clarins UV Plus (SPF 40). &lt;p&gt;
The La Roche Posay Fluide Extreme comes in several strengths; the strongest used to be SPF 60, but is now labelled as SPF 50 (due to a legal redefinition of the SPF scale). The next one down is a 40, etc. &lt;p&gt;
This product is a light fluid, in texture not unlike Clarins UV  Plus (SPF 40) and Dermalogica Super Sensitive Faceblock SPF 30. While the latter two are physical-only reflective sunscreens, LRP is a combination of titanium dioxide and Mexoryl (chemical absorbers, but carefully encapsulated, and with much research on safety and efficacy). I thought it worth a try, as it had good reviews re. safety and appropriateness for sensitive skin. It is unperfumed. &lt;p&gt;
This stuff behaves much like the Clarins and the Demalogica. It should be applied after your usual moisturiser (not, please note, instead of). Shake well before use. It is a very light fluid, and one only needs a small blob about the diameter of a dime/EUR 5c/GBP1p piece. That seems too little, but the formula is different from other sunscreens (less background padding/fillers). Apply all over face, neck, ears, and around eyes. Rub in a little. It will dry in an invisible way; on drier skin, it&#039;ll be matte (but not drying), I gather than on oilier skin it may be slightly shiny. You&#039;ll know if you&#039;ve put on too much, as there will be a white cast. &lt;p&gt;
I tested this against the Clarins (one on each side of the face for a day), and the Clarins was better. In that the the Clarins side was smooth as a millpond, while the LRP side reacted: irritation, blotchy bits, some flaking. I did this several days running, to monitor progress. LRP is so much cheaper than the Clarins that I really wanted it to work. Very scientific of me. The face continued to protest. I returned to the Clarins. The face returned to a happy state. &lt;p&gt;
That may all be specific to my skin; to LRP&#039;s credit, there was no burning. &lt;p&gt;
I would therefore recommend the Clarins over the LRP, but if and only if your skin is very sensitive and, to the best of your knowledge, is only content with physical blockers. &lt;p&gt;
I haven&#039;t used the Dermalogica for a while, though I liked it, as it&#039;s not as easy to lay one&#039;s paws on here in Ireland as the Clarins and the LRP. There seems to be only one place in Dublin selling it. Let me know, nice people out there in the ether, if you know of any easy way of getting it here, and if it&#039;s cheaper than the Clarins...

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,30,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,5,"This review is for Anthelios XL 50+ Fluide Extreme.  (Formerly known as 60+ but it is the same product).  This product required LOTS of research prior to purchasing.  For starters, no one seemed to be able to tell me (two dermatologist receptionsists, CVS pharmacists, Sephora, Nordstroms, Ulta) about this product, where I could buy it locally or what the difference was between the versions sold in the U.S. and abroad. So after about 2 hours on the Internet, here&#039;s the scoop.....The SPF15 version is the only La Roche Posay product that is FDA approved for sale in the U.S. You can buy it in the pharmacy department at CVS for $29. Unfortunately it only blocks 93% of UVA rays.  The SPF 30 version only blocks approximately 97%. So needless to say I opted to buy it from Skincarelab.com at a higher strength of 50+ to ensure 100% of UVA rays are blocked.  It was about $40 for 30ml which is 1 fluid oz.  The packaging is great so far and it is easy to use just the amount you need. I apply it directly with my index finger. La Roche Posay makes numerous sunscreen products, so it was a little intimidating to decide which product was best for me. But thanks to my fellow MUA reviewers, decided to go with the Fluide Extreme because of its lightweight texture. I bought this product because of reviews that this one is not as thick and does not leave a heavy white film and is the product to least likely to cause breakouts. After using it for about a week or so, I have no issues with any breakouts, irration or consistency of product. It goes on well and seems to be compatible with my overall skin regimen.  

CONS: I was dissappointed that the product insert information was in a few languages, but did not include English, so I was not able to learn anything about the product or how to use it with the insert LRP provided.  After reading some info. on MUA.com I was concerned about the comments that foundations that contain iron oxides (which mine does) may interfere with the product&#039;s effectiveness in blocking UVA rays. I also read that this product&#039;s effectiveness may be counteractive if worn with mineral makeup. So I e-mailed La Roche Posay to inquire about this, but received their generic reply &quot;since this product is not sold in the U.S. they could not provide me with any information&quot;.  Another thing, you have to apply Anthelios at least 30 minutes before applying your foundation.  This can be tricky if you are in a hurry to get out the door. So now I&#039;ve changed up my morning routine and apply my face products first thing! Due to the price of the product, I only use it on my face. I use Glytone Sunscreen SPF30 on my neck and Neutrogena Cooling Body Mist SPF 45 on an exposed skin areas.    

BOTTOMLINE: I will continue to buy this product because I&#039;m a firm believer in protecting your skin from the sun.  I am still a little concerned about the product&#039;s effectiveness when worn over makeup but will continue my research until I come to a conclusion.

It has a high alcohol content and irritated by skin TERRIBLY! It caused red bumps and stang my face upon application which were intolerable. Other than that if your skin can tolerate this, it is a very good sunscreen with high protection. It didn&#039;t make my face an oil slick and it didn&#039;t look greasy on me and i have oily skin.It also doesn&#039;t clog pores and is not very water resistant. It could easily be rinsed by a normal cleanser.

I&#039;m not going to say that this is &quot;the best sunscreen in the market&quot; but it&#039;s the best for me. It provides a very good sun protection for my everyday life. It also faded my brown spot (I couldn&#039;t believe it at first). The texture is better than other sunscreens I&#039;ve tried, even though it&#039;s a little bit oily for my T-zone area but not my whole face.

Anyway, I purchased 2 bottles(50ml)of this product from WestCoast Skincare online and waited with baited breath to receive my package! I recently had skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma) removed from my face(a super rare anomaly, I was told based on my coloring, etc..) and had plans to visit Thailand! So I wanted the highest available SPF on the market to cover my healing scar! Anyway, the bottles were super small, you had to shake them vigorously and be careful .. it spills out like WATER .. Fluide Extreme is the right name!! Since it was so liquidey - I ended up layering B Kamins Bio Maple suncreen, some local Thai sunscreen products, and some Bullfrog on my face!! I guess I am a texture girl! But, I did like the Anthelios Lip Balm 50 SPF and it comes in a cool package!

Terrible packaging, greasy product...left me an oil slicked mess, and caused huge, painful breakouts--was the only new item I had tried, so I am sure it was this product.  Had to go to the derm, as my skin was so bad.  He told me to NEVER use this again.  Also, I have seen quite a few people mention that when they are out in the sun for a few HOURS, they still turned brown or burned.  the problem with all these &quot;fancy&quot; new sunscreens with the high SPFs is that they give us all a FALSE sense of security, and lead many to stay out in the sun far too long.  Is it any wonder that since sunscreens have taken off in the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s, we have much higher levels of skin cancer??  And this does not just pertain to former sun worshippers, as people under 30 who have always worn sunscreen are also having problems!  I&#039;m going to stick with non-chemical sunscreens, and better yet, take extra precautions, such as covering more and wearing hats!

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,2,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,3,"I&#039;ve tried the Anthelios XL, Vichy 40 spray, and Ombrelle 60, 30, and 45 products, and I have to say that this sunscreen is my least favorite of all of the Mexoryl products I&#039;ve tried.  Unlike other reviewers, I don&#039;t mind the shininess factor of Mexoryl sunscreens, because I know that I will have to use a powder over a mexoryl sunblock.  What I don&#039;t like about this is that it&#039;s too thin, and feels like it&#039;s running off my face.  It just doesn&#039;t feel like enough of a protective barrier to me when it&#039;s really sunny out.  And the alcohol in it is drying and irritating to my skin.  I mean, is it too much to ask for a sunscreen that doesn&#039;t clog my pores OR have a ton of alcohol?  This stuff isn&#039;t so pore-clogging that I can&#039;t use it at all, but I have noticed a measurable decline in my skin quality (and rise in acne flare ups) since I started using it.  Won&#039;t repurchase.  I wish I could go back to XL, but it seems like they&#039;ve changed the formula and made it comedogenic. Why?

192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,0,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,5,"I read about how Meroxyl is the best sunscreen protection out there, but wasn&#039;t approved by the FDA until recently for use in this country. Therefore, you had to buy it from Canada or Europe, which made the product very expensive (it&#039;s already expensive). A small bottle is about $30. when I got it I thought I&#039;d go through a bottle in a month, but it actually lasted quite a bit longer. I only use it on my face, I use Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunblock on my body, but by using it on my face the anthelios has lasted months. It does come out runny and a bit greasy, but it doesn&#039;t take that much to cover your face, and once I put on a bit of powder it feel dry and looks relatively dry. I used to use the milk formula and that was much more greasy. This is good for the face because it is less greasy and mattes well. And the coverage is really good. I feel well protected even in 100 degree heat waves, just as long as I don&#039;t sweat too much. I&#039;m thinking of keeping one at work to reapply when I sweat some off.",2006-11-27T13:52:00.000Z,907752,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,watada,0,Acne-prone,Fair-Medium,Not Sure,Brunette,Straight,Medium,Brown,36-43,25
192,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,0,48043,Anthelios Ultra Light Face Sunscreen SPF 60,4,"This is incredibly expensive. It&#039;s about 40 USD for a teeny bottle (about 1 oz.) and can&#039;t really be easily had in the State anyhow. I had mine CP&#039;d for me. The texture is extremely liquidy and runny and it takes quite a while for it to absorb into the skin. Finish is very shiny afterwards. There might be a white cast but I&#039;m not certain as I only put this around my eyes (can&#039;t afford to put this all over my face, and am afraid to due to the greasy texture). No scent. Nice packaging too, but I think that I&#039;d feel better buying this if I got at least double what&#039;s in there.

I bought one bottle of this after I&#039;d heard it was the least noticeable sunblock available, well it&#039;s a lie. It definitely isn&#039;t greasy but it does leave this strange &#039;alien&#039;, slightly  metallic shine on my face.I am not too self conscious and like going out bare faced, but whenever I use this I just HAVE TO wear loose powder on top of it. That said, my skin looks fine afterwards, does not turn oily later on, does not burn either.Very efficient indeed. The thing that bothers me most with the powder is thinking that I am pushing it down my pores ( along with some sweat and what&#039;s left from the sunscreen..) when I reapply some of the stuff. In fact I am now using a cheaper version of it ( Garnier sensitive 50+, same Meroxyl sunscreen made by the same people : L&#039;Oreal ). It is thicker but the good side is it moisturises as well, whereas you will need to use a moisturizer with Anthelios.",2006-10-29T09:30:00.000Z,892526,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564496.JPG,Booksniffer,4,Dry,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Blue,36-43,23
