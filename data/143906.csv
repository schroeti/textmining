238,53,Bioré,22,Sunscreen,3,143906,UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++,3,"I have an off and on relationship with this sunscreen - it&#039;s a heck of a lot better than most Western sunscreens on the market, but it&#039;s not perfect for me. If I&#039;m living in a country where it&#039;s easy to get, I&#039;ll buy a tube, but if I can only get it online, I won&#039;t. 

Pros: Incredibly lightweight, great protection, and easy to carry in your purse or handbag. I love the citrusy smell. There is no white cast and it doesn&#039;t leave any shine on the face. Also, it&#039;s fairly inexpensive for the level of quality. 

Cons: It&#039;s quite drying. I have oily skin but this tends to dry out my skin. I don&#039;t mind this if I&#039;m not wearing any makeup on top, but if I&#039;m wearing makeup on top of this this will make my skin look haggard unless I&#039;m living in a tropical country where it&#039;s very humid. Because it&#039;s drying, my skin produces more oil to compensate which results in whiteheads. I usually combat this by double cleansing and exfoliating with an AHA toner at night, but sometimes it&#039;s too much of a hassle for me. 

Also on another note: this sunscreen is optimal for normal everyday use (going to the office, or day to day errands). But if you&#039;re on holiday or going to the beach, you should be using something with a bit more protection and honestly it should be a physical sunblock as opposed to a chemical sunscreen. I can tell you from personal use that I&#039;ve gotten more tan with this sunscreen than say, EltaMD&#039;s UV Clear Facial Sunscreen SPF 46, which is a mineral based sunscreen. 

Overall: My score is a 3.5. It&#039;s a cult favorite for a reason, but I like something with a bit more moisture even if my skin is quite oily. My HG is the Nivea Sun Protect Super Water Gel SPF 50/PA+++, which is more slippy and pleasant to use.

238,53,Bioré,22,Sunscreen,8,143906,UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++,5,"The hype is real with this Japanese cult favorite sunscreen. I&#039;ve been hearing about it for years, but just got to using it recently. I purchased a tube on amazon for $13. The price since then has been knocked down to $8.18. You get 50 g of product or 1.7 oz and SPF 50 + PA ++++ . I find the price to be cheap since I&#039;ve used other, more expensive sunscreens. There are also large tubes of this sunscreen for purchase, or it can be purchased in packs of 3 or more. The texture of the sunscreen is exactly what the name implies...watery! It&#039;s not thick in the slightest and is pleasantly thin. The scent of it varies from person to person. I&#039;ve read many reviews talking about how the 2019 formulation smells heavily of alcohol, but to me, it doesn&#039;t smell too heavy. I don&#039;t believe alcohol is bad for the skin if it&#039;s the proper kind of alcohol. Alcohol is often added to Asian sunscreens to make them cosmetically elegant or have a faster dry time. Asian sunscreens are among the best in the world and are far more advanced than their American counterparts. Upon application of this sunscreen on my face, there is no white cast or heavy feeling. It&#039;s somewhere between moisturizing and matte...so the best word I can use is SILKY. It just feels smooth to the touch. My boyfriend and one of our friends have been using this sunscreen and seem to really like it. Men seem to be fussy with the feeling of sunscreen on their skin, but they seem to love this one. They&#039;ve used so much that it might be finished within a month. I&#039;m probably going to order more of this sunscreen and maybe in a pack of 3! My skin type is oily combination and suffers from dehydration during winter. I don&#039;t think I will be using this sunscreen during the winter as much because I prefer something even more moisturizing, but it&#039;s perfect for the spring, summer, and maybe even fall. This is just an overall easy sunscreen to use and love. I definitely see why people are obsessed with it and can see myself becoming one of those people.

It leaves my skin feeling moisturized; but while still applying a good amount of spf. Sometimes it leaves a white cast, but if you really work it into the skin, it should be blended out just fine. This is perfect if you’re sweating, or going in the water, but just remember to reapply after a few hours ",2019-07-02T02:24:21.000Z,3056677,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564493.JPG,xolatte,2,Acne-prone,Medium,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,25-29,13
238,53,Bioré,22,Sunscreen,3,143906,UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++,5,"This is a first impression so I will update later when I get to use this more. When buying sunscreen for my age it is important for me to find that it covers both UVA and UVB and that it has SPF 50+. In comparison with my other sunscreens, it applies like a thick serum on the skin and it is absorbed very quickly. There is no white cast and my skin felt so smooth and no greasy texture at all (I am a combination normal/oily). Doesn’t feel heavy or dry. The only drawback is that you can smell the alcohol when applied (it is listed second on the ingredients list after water) but the scent disappears once it’s absorbed.

I bought it from YesStyle for AUD$13.83 so the price is really good and I actually bought two so one for me and one for my daughter. So far so good!",2019-07-01T01:54:08.000Z,3056609,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564493.JPG,Christycaxxx,3,Combination,Medium Brown,Warm,Black,Kinky,Medium,Brown,36-43,62
238,53,Bioré,22,Sunscreen,3,143906,UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++,2,"I had a hard time deciding on the overall rating for this suncreen; it destroyed my face, but I love using it everywhere else. After a few weeks of using this product, my face was covered in inflammatory acne. While I have had mild acne for many years, it suddenly got very bad. I started using this sunscreen as soon as I started using Differin, and although I know it&#039;s not the best idea to start more than one new product at a time, I did anyway based off of the fantastic reviews for both products. I thought I was going through a Differin &quot;purge&quot; stage, but to be sure, I stopped using the sunscreen on the uppermost part of my neck--right under my chin--and my skin, in turn, cleared up in that area. So, please do a patch test of this product, especially if you deal with acne. 

For my body, however, I love this suncreen for its easy, non-greasy, satin application/finish. It may not be realistic to use this if you&#039;re out in the sun a lot/for long periods of time, as you pay a pretty penny per ounce for this stuff.",2019-05-14T17:18:00.000Z,3053589,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564493.JPG,DLynnIsIn,3,Combination,Fair,Cool,Other,Wavy,Fine,Green,30-35,4

It goes on easily and sinks in nicely, wears well under makeup. I have read it’s better for incidental sun exposure than for spending long periods in the sun. Unfortunately it gives me small whiteheads so I won’t buy it again, but I would say it’s worth a try.

238,53,Bioré,22,Sunscreen,7,143906,UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++,5,"This sunscreen has been a Godsend for me. Being on the oily side, this product is one of the only sunscreens that fully absorbs and doesn&#039;t leave me looking like a greasy mess. 

It&#039;s nice and lightweight. Since it&#039;s so thin, it spreads easily, and a little goes a very long way. It has a light citrusy scent, although it can also be comparable to Flarp (y&#039;know, that slime stuff we stuck our fingers into as kids that made farting noises - at least that&#039;s what it initially reminded me of).

I know there&#039;s some mixed feelings towards it regarding the alcohol used in it. I&#039;m of the belief that a small amount of alcohol, at least for more oily complexions, isn&#039;t harmful (in fact, this is my only product with alcohol in it, and my skin is no more worse for the wear). Of course, if you&#039;re sensitive to products with alcohol, I&#039;d recommend staying away from this sunscreen. Otherwise, if you&#039;re an oily person looking for a light, quickly absorbing sunscreen with good coverage, I couldn&#039;t recommend this more highly.",2019-04-14T14:04:00.000Z,3050214,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564493.JPG,peaches2217,7,Oily,Fair,Cool,Brunette,Wavy,Fine,Hazel,19-24,12
238,53,Bioré,22,Sunscreen,4,143906,UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++,4,"Probably the most famous asian sunscreen ever and for good reason too! The watery goop texture slides beautifully onto the skin, dries off very quickly and leaves no cast or disturbances to the skin, and the SPF is amazing! It&#039;s also quite cheap and is quite readily available to the average consumer due to it&#039;s popularity, and I have no gripes with recommending it to people! With all these nice things to say about this sunscreen, in the contrary I have come to the conclusion that it&#039;s sadly not my HG. The slight alcohol scent is not my fave and the alcohol smell becomes of bigger discomfort when I over-apply the product, though the lemon scent I do not mind at all if it was only that.

It also makes makeup application a bit weird? Like it can make makeup less blendable around the skin and can pill if you apply too much sunscreen and not wait for it to fully dry so definitely wait for it to dry, if you feel absolutely no watery textures on you skin at all thats the go-to!

My eyes are quite sensitive, a lot of cosmetics can make my eyes watery and I came into this issue of a larger scale when using it everyday as sunscreen in a very hot and humid climate (Singapore). I do acknowledge that I was probably using it too close to my eyes but this product literally made my eyes water and made me uncomfortable for the first like 3-5 hours after application. I&#039;ve tried things like the La Roche-Posay sunscreens and I&#039;ve had virtually no issues with it near my eyes, and I do attribute it to the alcohol in the Biore one. 

I still have a bittersweet love with this sunscreen as it introduced me to a world of revolutionary sunscreens where I don&#039;t have to run into issues such as thick, difficult to apply sunscreens and that distinct harsh sunscreen smell and this product is definitely my gateway-drug into amazing sunscreens! As mentioned before, I still do recommend this to generally everyone as it&#039;s such a great sunscreen and I&#039;ve had many friends who&#039;ve fell in love with this product. The texture is absolutely amazing and makes applying sunscreen a dream, I do not mind buying this again if I can&#039;t find any of my current faves.

238,53,Bioré,22,Sunscreen,5,143906,UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++,3,"100% non-white cast and non-shiny, cost-effective SPF50 sunscreen...sounds like a dream come true right? Yes, but unfortunately it&#039;s a short-lived one. The amount of alcohol in this is not good at all, regardless of how oily a skin type one might have, as I discovered into week No.2 of using this. My cheeks and forehead became super flaky. I think when there&#039;s this much alcohol, plus fragrance and citrus ingredients it can be a recipe for disaster for sensitive skin types. I immediately stopped using it and my skin went back to its normal self in about 3 days. Regardless of that I won&#039;t dispose of this as I&#039;m happy to use for short durations (2 or 3 days maximum) where UV exposure requires a higher SPF than what I normally wear, i.e a summer weekend in Dubai for example but for long term use, absolutely not!

I&#039;ve been using this daily for the past 4 years, and I&#039;ve repurchased this over and over again. I hate sunscreens that are greasy or that leave a tacky or oily film on your face, and this does a great job of just sinking into your skin without leaving a trace. I can&#039;t feel it once it dries! It leaves my skin feeling hydrated, but not tacky or oily. Its formula is slightly watery, and is very easy to spread across my face. It also dries pretty quickly and does not leave a white cast in photos. It is, however, not particularly useful for events in which you will be perspiring a lot (you might want to get a more heavy-duty sunscreen for that!). For day-to-day use, it works well and gives you a good base to apply your make up.

Japanese sunscreens as a whole are incredible, there is huge demand domestically for effective high-quality sunscreens that look good on the skin, and as competition is so fierce prices are generally low. This one is fairly cheap, it&#039;s readily available online although some sellers will add a huge markup to the price, so be careful. Comes in a 50mL squeezy tube as depicted, although the packaging now looks a little different with an updated design, and has been reformulated so it now offers PA++++ UVA protection as well as SPF50.  

It&#039;s as the name suggests, a thin and watery product that is similar in consistency to the lightweight essence products popular in the region. It contains chemical sunscreens, so doesn&#039;t leave any white or greasy cast, and sinks quickly into skin leaving a nearly undetectable finish - I can quite happily use the recommended quarter teaspoon amount on my face without it looking or feeling like I&#039;ve smeared a layer of butter all over it. However, it contains alcohol and has a lemony scent - my skin is quite oily, so alcohol in products doesn&#039;t dry it out that much, and generally ok with fragranced products. If you have dry and/or sensitive skin, and it doesn&#039;t tolerate fragrance or alcohol well, proceed with caution.

I absolutely love this sunscreen.
It is almost like a gel, has a light citrusy smell and completely absorbs into your skin. It contains hyaluronic acid, royal jelly and a citrus mix. It does not break me out which is fabulous. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s waterproof though. So I would not recommend it for physical activity (in that case go for La Roche Posay Anthelios XL or Shiseido Anessa).

Just ordered the new version with PA++++. (Highter UVA protection). I really hope the texture will be the same. Got it on amazon for £10. The newer version is supposed to be sweat and waterproof. 

The UV filters are the same in both versions:
- Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate / Octinoxate
- Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine / Tinosorb S
- Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate / Uvinal A Plus

238,53,Bioré,22,Sunscreen,7,143906,UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++,4,"So I live in Australia and I&#039;m used to the  run-of-the-mill, greasy Australian sunscreen with that distinct white cast. I&#039;m pretty oily to begin with and so applying an oily sunscreen on top of my already reflective face obviously doesn&#039;t help. So I went on a search for The One True Sunscreen... 
Fast-forward me reading countless blogs, top-ten reviews and reddit, I finally narrowed down to this one as it was available at a Korean beauty store near where I lived. After taking this bad boy home, I couldn&#039;t wait to try it - was it actually a real &#039;non-greasy&#039; sunscreen, that wouldn&#039;t send my skin down another breakout tunnel? 

THE RESULTS
Finally, here&#039;s the part you actually wanted to know... Is it non-greasy or just another shiny creme?!?!  Okay, let me confess: I&#039;m in love. It&#039;s a super lightweight cream (for a sunscreen) and goes on my face like a dream, leaving my skin feeling, yes, actually hydrated! I apply this after cleansing, toning and a light moisturiser. I can&#039;t remember where I read this, but I generally give it a couple of minutes to set before applying foundation or powder and have found that it works wonderfully as a base on which to apply foundation, win-win hey? On the sun-protection front, 50+ spa and PA+++ makes me one happy camper (I mean I&#039;m gonna be real here - I&#039;m not fussed with 30 SPF either okay, so something with a little lower wouldn&#039;t have mattered). 

Now, the two things that I&#039;m not completely in love with... 
2/5 Smell: Let me state here, that personally I&#039;m not a fan of scents, but hey this is a matter of taste for every individual
3/5 Price: Before you start questioning me, I know $15 doesn&#039;t compare to your top-of-the-range stuff, however for value you ain&#039;t gonna beat the drugstore brands. Hopefully one day I can go to Japan and stock up on these babies, but until then, I&#039;ll probably play an alternating game between this and my cheap tinted sunscreen from Priceline.

The formula itself is a very loose cream. The packaging is a typical squeeze tube, and I found that applying medium pressure to the bottle dispensed far too much product; using a lighter touch with the packaging to dispense the product, one bottle lasts about six-eight weeks of daily use.

I was a bit hesitant on using it at first since my skin is known to be on the sensitive side, so not having the ingredients list in a language I could understand worried me for a moment. All these worries were for nought, however. This is a very light gel that spreads thinly and comes with heavy SPF so you only need one layer of it, and using two doesn&#039;t use a whole lot of product if you want to be extra cautious. It dries into a matte but doesn&#039;t dry out the skin at all, unlike some other Japanese sunscreens I tried (which turned out to be contain alcohol, which is terrible for my skin). You really only need one drop for the face and maybe one for your hands. The packaging is easy to carry around all day in a purse, which is useful during the summer.

I used it under a moisturizer, which is probably the best policy since I am unsure whether it moisturizes on its own. It works perfectly beneath make up since the finish is so matte.

I&#039;ve repurchased this multiple times and am actually quite anxious about having to switch to the new 2017 formula since I hear it is less cosmetically elegant. 

I put on a thick layer every day and it settles in super quickly and feels like absolutely nothing on the whole day. I even think it provides a slight blurring effect, smoothing some texture issues I have even though this is not one of the properties advertised. My skin is combo, dry and flaky on cheeks while somewhat greasy in the T-zone and this does not irritate my dry patches or exacerbate my oiliness. I normally avoid alcohol in face products, but its presence here does not bother my skin.

Caveats:
*I do use an oil cleanser to remove this at the end of the day. I have very clog prone skin and if I remove with an oil cleanser this does not break me out. 

*I have noticed that when I use this sunscreen during hot weather (read: really sweaty), I have picked up some color.

238,53,Bioré,22,Sunscreen,3,143906,UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF50+ PA+++,1,"i decided to try this sunscreen because of it&#039;s rave reviews on amazon, r/skincareaddiction and r/asianbeauty. it&#039;s supposed to be cosmetically elegant, meaning it applies easily and dries quickly with a matte finish, which is great for people who wear makeup. it has a very, very strong alcohol scent to it, which isn&#039;t surprising, because biore sunscreens are usually chalk full of the stuff -- that&#039;s what makes it so great for applying under makeup. however, i don&#039;t wear makeup; i just wanted something that dried quickly and didn&#039;t make my skin feel yucky like american sunscreens do. anyway, after applying this, i immediately felt a stinging sensation upon my cheeks. it was uncomfortable, but i decided to ignore it and go about my day to see if it would stop. the pros? i didn&#039;t break out and it settled into my skin pretty quick, which i liked. it didn&#039;t even feel like i had sunscreen on, so i can definitely see why people like it for that reason alone. it definitely had a matte finish, however, it was so incredibly drying and caused a such stinging sensation that i couldn&#039;t stand it. as soon as i got home from class, i washed it off and my skin felt so much better. if you&#039;re someone who is dry/dehydrated, i would definitely not recommend this sunscreen. if you want to try it anyway, make sure to put a decent moisturizer on before! there are plenty of better asian sunscreens out there that are just as great without the alcohol, like skin aqua moisture milk.

This high SPF SS texture is awesome. White colored gel cream and fresh citrusy scent. It&#039;s lightweight and slightly cooling upon application. Fast absorbing &amp; leave your skin hydrated and soft to touch (probably the silicone in it) also no whitecast detected. Perfect for under makeup.

That was my experience for the first half of the tube. What come next is.. I start to develop deep cyst all over my face. My forehead which always acne/pimple/cyst free is a MESS (back then when I use this Biore SS). I&#039;m mortified..

At first I suspect alcohol was the culprit, but I remembered I have use alcohol based toner before, and my face seems fine albeit the dryness. Then the silicone, but I recall I use silicone primer before I meet Biore, and my forehead is fine. Silicones caused slightly whiteheads on nose &amp; cheek but no pimples.. no pimples on forehead

Then I racked this Biore ingredients again and I found they use AGAR as ingredients.. AGAR!!!

Now I learned after all the products causing breakouts, my skin never ever agreed with AGAR,  all of Algae families, fermented Algae proteins, Spirulina families, Gelatins and Caraageenan. It&#039;s okay when consumed Agar, but when applied topically, Boom! My skin breakouts in hives of pimples. Thankyou..

I don&#039;t want to waste products so whatever didn&#039;t agreed on my face I used them on my arms/legs and..hello pimples ???? I have pimples on my inner arm.. God please help, it&#039;s weird.. I toss it to my garbage bin.

If you&#039;re not sensitive with those ingredients, go for Biore. This SS has a lovely texture &amp; finish, great under makeup, also great value for the price given.",2017-09-05T00:37:00.000Z,2982275,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3564493.JPG,yellowguitar,9,Oily,Fair-Medium,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,25-29,19

Unfortunately I am not impressed at all.
The first thing I noticed when opening a tube is  alcohol smell which is strong enough even for my not very picky nose.
My skin isn&#039;t sensetive either but upon application it got red and a little stingy.
After a couple of uses my skin got used to the cream and didn&#039;t react any more.
But with this amount of alcohol it will not do any good if you have sensetive skin.

Now about its sun protective power: if you don&#039;t want to pick up any color during summer time it&#039;s not for you. I usually don&#039;t go to the beach before 5 pm. Normally I wear mineral sunscreens with zinc oxide for the beach but a couple of times I applied only biore and did pick up tan. I didn&#039;t burn bit I did suntanned. I would not rely solely on sunscreen when going to the beach especially this one! Hat, glasses and shade are your friends if you care about your skin. Also I think mineral sunscreens protect better in summer time.
Also, probably because of its watery consistency I ran out of it very quickly - in a month or so not wearing it everyday. 
The only pros I can name are the finish it gives and it&#039;s light, cosmetically ellegant formula ( very smooth skin,  foundation applies easily on top of the sunscreen), buy my missha cream does the same without that much alcohol.

Westerners are used to white casts and sunscreeny smells, so this didn&#039;t even feel like a sunscreen the first time I put it on. It was remarkably lightweight, completely clear once rubbed into the skin, and it had a faint citrusy scent. I was going out into a brutal summer day that time, so I really felt I needed protection and the initial feeling after application did not strike me as very assuring.

At the end of the day, it was as though my face was untouched by the sun. I was mind-blown. Just how lightweight this product was, and how easily it trampled all the previous sunscreens I&#039;d used in efficiency! In my opinion, it beats the Perfect Milk of the same brand as well.

Then i apply a dime size amount to face, neck, and chest.  It is a gel like substance that quickly absorbs into my skin.

This gel has a wonderful cooling effect that is so refreashing and perfect when it is hot and muggy.  I love the way makeup goes over this.

Of all the sunscreens I&#039;ve tried over the years this is one of the best. The problem I and many others have with most sunscreens is either a white caste or an oily greasy looking layer. This goes on and within seconds seems to sink in with no trace. Normally you have to compromise on the SPF rating to get a product that is able to be so discrete. Now bear in mind this is SPF 50+ which frankly is as good as it gets.

I bought this based off the high reviews and off of Ratzilla&#039;s website. After buying this off Amazon for a decent price, I tried it and quite enjoy the feel of it. Like the picture, it is a light blue tubed package that is gel type consistency. It&#039;s like a off-whiteish color gel color. It does contain alcohol in it so some people may not like it but it does help with the drying so it does not feel sticky on the face.  I can&#039;t remember if there was any scent to the product - though some have mentioned it has that lemon type scent. I just know it is not an offensive scent so it does not bother me. If you have dry skin, this could make your skin more dry due to the alcohol content but I think it works well. It does not leave my face sticky nor does it leave a white cast on my face and my skin tone is NC30. This sunscreen is used as an everyday product - not so much for long outdoor times as there are other sunscreens that are meant for outdoor. It has not broke me out nor have I developed any milia. Depending on which cream you use, the sunscreen may pill but that really depends on the cream. I have tried some moisturizers that have made my sunscreen pill and others which has not so it depends on the mixture of creams and ingredients. Overall, I would and have repurchased this sunscreen. There is a new formulation coming out this year and will likely buy that once I have finished running out of my currently supplies.

I am down to 2/3 of the bottle remaining after about 3 weeks. I haven&#039;t found a full body sunscreen yet, so I just have been using this on my arms in addition to standard spots I use all my other anti-aging and nourishing products (face, neck, chest, ears, hands / wrists).  

Last year I noticed that my arm freckles did not go away in the winter as usual. Frequently I will head out to &quot;prune something&quot; and end up working for 4-5 hours with no sun protection. I&#039;m not really good at remembering to apply sunblock, so finally just adding it to my grooming routine has made a huge difference.  My hands are much lighter (arms will follow on early I start using products to combat the hyperpigmentation).

But, I&#039;m getting older and accepting not only that I&#039;m slowly but surely aging, but I&#039;m also at higher risk for skin cancer. Redheads don&#039;t tan- we fry. Like bacon. I heard that this was a good one and ordered a bottle as a trial.

It is a smaller sized bottle. I apply to my face and my hands (and up my arms depending on sleeve length). That much skin area adds up quickly. I&#039;ll definitely need more stock in one order since this stuff typically ships direct from Japan. 

Oh, yeah, I&#039;m planning on repurchasing. Why? It really does work. You&#039;ll definitely need to reapply during the day if you&#039;re outside for an extended time, just like others. But I brought this with me on a trip to Finland during the summer (when it&#039;s mostly daylight there during the season). I especially took care to apply it before a day trip to the zoo. Save for a little bit of burning on the back of my neck, I was crisp free! And even then the burning on my neck was incredibly minor to the point that I only felt a tinge of tingle. 

Other positives: I find it comfortable to apply and wear. I&#039;m very oily but the alcohol hasn&#039;t really broke me out or anything. It also worked okay under my makeup when I&#039;ve tried that.

I do want to try the face milk one as well, since I&#039;ve heard that that&#039;s better for my skin type. But I&#039;m really satisfied with this so far.

If you can get your hands on this, buy it. Now. Hands down the best face sunscreen I&#039;ve used.

Previously had been using Missha&#039;s Sun Milk but they raised the price (more than double) so was looking for something cheaper. I can&#039;t use western sunblocks as it causes redness/stinging (and I have rosacea).

It&#039;s a light gel-lotion consistency that is slightly cooling upon application. Absolutely no white cast/film and once dry, it feels like nothing on your skin. Absolutely no irritation to my sensitive skin. I use it over my moisturizer, let it dry for a minute or two and then apply makeup and I&#039;ve had no issues with it whatsoever. 

The bad is that because it&#039;s so lightweight, if I am actively out in the sun, I feel like it doesn&#039;t last long/sweats off easily, but you&#039;re not quite sure what a good time to reapply is. And this is somewhat tricky to get your hands on in North America except through 3rd parties so shelf life may be questionable. I can sometimes find it on Amazon (but mostly get relatives to pick it up) and it&#039;s only around $15CAD.
