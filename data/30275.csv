80,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,2,30275,"Anthelios XL ,SPF 60+",4,"Okay, so I actually bought this by accident, thinking it was the fluid (it was in a &quot;bonus/2 for 1 package and the cardboard packaging made it difficult to see what the product was).  I also have about 5 minis of these which I carry in my purse and take for travel as well.

For starters, this stuff is greasy and will leave your face SHINY.  But I use this on my hands/arms so that&#039;s not an  issue but I&#039;ve also started to use this as an eye cream for daytime.  Ever since my beloved Clarins eye cream with sun screen was discontinued, I&#039;ve been looking for something to replace it and I&#039;ve still not found anything. Ole Henriksen, Clinique, Shiseido (now also discontinued) - none of them measured up.  So I gave up, gave in and decided to give this a try.  It works!  And it is more moisturizing than Clarins&#039;s, which was very non-greasy (sort of a good thing since if I needed to, I could apply an eye cream underneath). I use a small amount (from the mini tube which is about the size of an eye cream tube) and make sure to get it where I have the most evidence of sun damage (2 spots in almost the exact same location on both eyes - I think it&#039;s where the sun has always been able to get past my glass or sun glasses, both of which do have sun protection coatings on them but they don&#039;t obscure my entire eye area from brows to half way down my face).  If I let this sit for a few minutes, I find that concealer and other eye makeup all apply without any problems.  And unlike a lot of other products I&#039;ve tried (like Ole&#039;s SPF 15 eye cream) this does not sting my eyes, even in a hot yoga class, where I&#039;m sweating profusely.",2016-07-18T09:10:00.000Z,2905741,thumb/h/145/7_8_4_9_1295366.JPG,mariella99,2,Dry,Fair,Cool,Brown,Wavy,Coarse,Brown,44-55,1477

- It feels very heavy and oily
- It aggravates my skin and promotes breakouts
- It make MOLES GROW!  Yes, there&#039;s something so irritating in this stuff that a few days use will make small moles react to it and start to increase in size. Not good at all!!!
- I definitely cannot use it near my eyes without its oily formula migrating and causing irritation, plus it makes my under-eyes puffy, even though it&#039;s a &quot;face and body cream&quot;.

I found this product too greasy for my oily skin. It was hard to spread and it did not sink into my skin and it felt like a mask. The next day I had bumps on my forehead. Thankfully Shoppers Drug mart let me exchange it for a different sunscreen.  I bought Avene Lait 40 SPF this time (see my review for Avene).

My skin and the sun do not get along. I have to have a very high SPF or I&#039;ll burn almost instantly. Most sunscreens also break me out terribly though, and leave my skin with a greasy film, and that sunscreen smell. I can&#039;t stand the texture and smell of 90% of the sunscreens out there. 

Never burned when using this, not once. It melts into my skin, and I can wear makeup over it without any problems. I&#039;ve been using it for 3-4 months and so far no breakouts. It only feels like sunscreen for a few minutes, and eventually just blends into my skin, without leaving behind any smell or visible clue that I&#039;m wearing it. I just love it. And I can actually use the amount I need without feeling like I&#039;m loading it on (tablespoon for face, shot glass for body) because it absorbs so well. 

My skin is very happy with this :)",2011-03-13T21:18:00.000Z,2030595,thumb/h/145/7_8_4_9_1295366.JPG,kittybearchiyo,2,Oily,Fair,Cool,Brunette,Wavy,Fine,Green,Under 18,56
80,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,1,30275,"Anthelios XL ,SPF 60+",5,"Renewed faith in this product. The first time I ever used this was this past summer and around that time, I was trying out a new moisturizer -- biggest mistake ever! After many months and weeks of swapping things in and out of my skin care routine just to see what&#039;s messing my skin up, I&#039;ve worked out the moisturizer was breaking me out! I thought it was this sunscreen that was breaking me out, but it was the moisturizer. I was trying out the Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer. It&#039;s terrible. I had rounds of break outs, mostly cystic pimples! Once they start to subside and calm down, another round would come. It was a never ending cycle. I am still dealing with the marks from all this breaking out. Anyways, I used this SPF recently when I went on a trip and it didn&#039;t break me out at all. It comes in a small plastic bottle container with a screw top. You have to shake it really well to mix the content up before applying to your face. It absorbs super fast into the skin and it was rather light. It does feel a tad bit greasy initially when I was applying it with my fingers, but once it absorbs into the skin, it&#039;s really not a problem at all. And it&#039;s not sticky! I think it&#039;s a bit on the expensive side and the price is comparable to the department store brands, but I think this is worth the investment. A little bit goes a long way and that little bottle (1.7 oz) has lasted me through the summer and then some. I actually like the small bottle packaging because it&#039;s small and the bottle is thin, not big and bulky. I can throw into my makeup bag or handbag and carry it with me. And this will protect from UVA and UVB rays! ",2010-12-03T14:50:00.000Z,1958438,thumb/h/145/7_8_4_9_1295366.JPG,lilacs80,1,Combination,Fair-Medium,Warm,Black,Straight,Medium,Brown,30-35,21

This was the number #1 product in regards to protection against UVA rays. A lot of sunscreens only measure UVB by the SPF value. UVA is measured by PA+++, but I have never seen it in any Canadian or U.S sunscreen. It is probably due to labelling requirements by law. Anyways, this completelyyyyyyyyyy clogged my pores. Thank goodness I only tested it on my forehead for 2 days. Prior to putting the sunscreen, I had very smooth skin especially on the forehead.

I purchased this for around $25 CDN. I agree fully with the some of the reviews below that mention the pros &amp; cons. It offers excellent protection, but the finish leaves something to be desired.

The price is decent for the amount you get (100ml), and the texture is nice (but extremely thick in consistency).

I was in Shopper&#039;s yesterday and Biotherm has some high SPFs and they are NOT supposed to be greasy. Plus the good thing with Shopper&#039;s is that if you keep the bill, they will refund your money if you&#039;re not happy so I think I will give it a try. 

Anyone here have any experience with Biotherm? I did check it out in the product reviews but only one person posted a review but it was favourable. If not Biotherm, I would really appreciate some recommendations on a good SPF for the face that doesn&#039;t feel like greasepaint and give you a shine.",2008-05-28T09:46:00.000Z,1263191,thumb/h/145/7_8_4_9_1295366.JPG,bolistoli,0,Sensitive,Fair,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,44-55,12

So, my skin is sensitive to sun and normally I wear  Japanese brand sunscreen such as OMI or my derm&#039;s sunscreen. But I wanted to raise my SPF notch up, that&#039;s why I tried LRP Antelios SPF 60.

Luckily it was a sample, cuz I had bumps after wearing it for a day.
Although this fluid is suitalble for Normal/Oily skin like me, I still think this formular is too heavy and contains too much alcohol.

Eventhough it left sticky and shiny layer, the alcohol triggered my SD.
I had trouble removing it without rubbing my face too hard ( PRO: waterproof is effective )and bumps came up along my forehead.

Summary:

I bought it during a promotion and although the rep from LRP was completely sun damaged and haggared with really awful skin I still bought it. The company should seriously consider the integrity of their employees&#039; skin if they are sending them into stores to promote the benefits of using SPF 60 XL but I digress. I bought it and I love it. I haven&#039;t had any breakouts and my skin looks really good.  I used it all summer on its own without layering over moisturizer but I may start using a lightweight moisturizer underneath during the winter months. Due to the high SPF, it really leaves a sheen on my skin. I like the dewy look but this sunscreen leaves me too shiny. I use a lightweight sheer pressed powder on top and its fine. Since I started using this sunscreen a few months ago, my husband told me I actually have fewer lines. The packaging is great too with a hygienic squeeze bottle.

80,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,0,30275,"Anthelios XL ,SPF 60+",2,"I have fair skin that has been known to burn in the rain and is sensitive and photosensitive, producing spectacular blotchy hives at the literal drop of a hat. It also reacts to non-physical UV blockers with amusing breakouts. I have been wearing sunscreens of one sort or another for decades; usually one for the face and one for the rest of the delectable self. My current tipple of choice for the face is the Clarins UV Plus (SPF 40). &lt;p&gt;
The La Roche Posay Fluide Extreme comes in several strengths; the strongest used to be called &quot;SPF 60,&quot; but is now labelled as SPF 50 (due to a legal redefinition of the SPF scale). The next one down is a 40, etc. &lt;p&gt;
This product is a light fluid, in texture not unlike Clarins UV Plus (SPF 40) and Dermalogica Super Sensitive Faceblock SPF 30. While the latter two are physical-only reflective sunscreens, LRP is a combination of titanium dioxide and Mexoryl (chemical absorbers, but carefully encapsulated, and with much research on safety and efficacy). I thought it worth a try, as it had good reviews re. safety and appropriateness for sensitive skin. It is unperfumed. &lt;p&gt;
This stuff behaves much like the Clarins and the Demalogica. It should be applied after your usual moisturiser (not, please note, instead of). Shake well before use. It is a very light fluid, and one only needs a small blob about the diameter of a dime/EUR 5c/GBP1p piece. That seems too little, but the formula is different from other sunscreens (less background padding/fillers). Apply all over face, neck, ears, and around eyes. Rub in a little. It will dry in an invisible way; on drier skin, it&#039;ll be matte (but not drying), I gather than on oilier skin it may be slightly shiny. You&#039;ll know if you&#039;ve put on too much, as there will be a white cast. &lt;p&gt;
I tested this against the Clarins (one on each side of the face for a day), and the Clarins was better. In that the the Clarins side was smooth as a millpond, while the LRP side reacted: irritation, blotchy bits, some flaking. I did this several days running, to monitor progress. LRP is so much cheaper than the Clarins that I really wanted it to work. Very scientific of me. The face continued to protest. I returned to the Clarins. The face returned to a happy state. &lt;p&gt;
That may all be specific to my skin; to LRP&#039;s credit, there was no burning. &lt;p&gt;
I would therefore recommend the Clarins over the LRP, but if and only if your skin is very sensitive and, to the best of your knowledge, is only content with physical blockers. &lt;p&gt;
I haven&#039;t used the Dermalogica for a while, though I liked it, as it&#039;s not as easy to lay one&#039;s paws on here in Ireland as the Clarins and the LRP. There seems to be only one place in Dublin selling it. Let me know, nice people out there in the ether, if you know of any easy way of getting it here, and if it&#039;s cheaper than the Clarins...

I&#039;m switching to sunscreens that contain tinosorb M, the best long-wave UVA blocker available today. My current recomendation is Ducray SPF 50+ Cream (see my review).


PREVIOUS REVIEW: This sunscreen (Anthelios Lait 50+ (used to be called 60 but new labeling laws made it change names)) is good because it has a high PPD, but there are a couple La Roche Posay sunscreens I like better.  Anthelios AQUALAIT 50+ has all the protection of regular Lait 50+, but Aqualait has high water resistance and less shine.  I used to like Anthelios Dermo-Pediatrics 50+ for the same reasons, but after a few months my skin developed dry red spots from using Dermo-Pediatrics. So I prefer Aqualait now. I also like the Anthelios SPRAY 50+. It is virtually unnoticable on my skin, and is the least shiny of the many La Roche Posay sunscreens I&#039;ve tried. It&#039;s also water resistant. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s as water resistant as Aqualait, though, and the PPD is 20 vs. Aqualiat&#039;s 28, so Aqualait can still compete with the spray for my money.  Anyway, I&#039;d choose Aqualait over the Lait.",2007-01-16T13:41:00.000Z,934879,thumb/h/145/7_8_4_9_1295366.JPG,JohnsonM,3,Oily,Unknown,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Green,30-35,6

80,1294,La Roche-Posay,22,Sunscreen,2,30275,"Anthelios XL ,SPF 60+",5,"I love this, I use it everyday, it is my HG sunscreen and moisturizer.  I have worn it cycling in 80+ degree weather and still didn&#039;t burn even while sweating.  There seems to be 2 types of this, Anthelios XL Creme 60+(facial cream) and Anthelios XL Lait 60+ (face and body).  The facial cream is heavier than the Lait, and so I use it in the winter when I need more moisture and the Lait in the summer when I need something lighter.  You have to be careful with this not to use too much or else it will get greasy, but if you use it sparingly and wait at least 5 minutes before applying makeup to allow it to sink in you can minimize that problem.  I have also found that I rarely need an evening moisturizer since I started using this because it is moisturizing and it has some kind of reflective particles that give your skin a nice glow.

My routine is this: Shiseido the Skincare gentle cleansing foam, then skinceuticals C+E+Ferulic, then Anthelios XL Lait 60+ in the morning, and at night the Shiseido cleansing foam and the C+E+Ferulic (no moisturizer).  Every 1-2 weeks I do a glycolic peel with MUAC peels.  My skin looks the best that it ever has.

UPDATE: The above routine worked out great when I was in my late 20s, but my skin no longer tolerates the Skinceuticals and I&#039;d like a day cream that performs better than this as far as improving my skin. So I don&#039;t use this day-to-day anymore, but anytime I&#039;m in the sun for a prolonged period of time I still use this cream.

The only thing that holds me back a little is that it shines...So it is not that easy to use everyday if you have combo or oily skin, although I do. I just use my powder more!
Besides this fact, I think the protection it offers is far superior of everything else I have tried and I can sense that difference immediatelly cause I have sun-reactive skin. This is the only suncsreen so far that I can rely on in the summer!
I would defenately repurchase for summer use (at the beach) and for winter skiing, but for everyday use, I might search some more for something less oily. If I do not find something similar, I&#039;ll stick to this and cover the shinies with my powder!
