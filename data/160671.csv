62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,2,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,2,"I don&#039;t really like this sunscreen. It&#039;s greasy and thick. This does not work well under makeup at all, but to be fair maybe they didn&#039;t intend for it to be used that way.
So I gave this to my husband in an effort to not waste money, because he works outside. The times he does use it (which honestly I think is only when I&#039;ve basically put it on him myself lol) it is a little hard to rub in and even makes his usually dry face feel greasy. 
I just don&#039;t really have any good things to say about this. I have used it while going to the beach a few times, but only because I didn&#039;t want to bring my more expensive sunscreen with me to the beach lol. It does prevent sunburn, so there&#039;s that! I won&#039;t be repurchasing this.",2019-03-26T19:56:00.000Z,3048189,thumb/h/145/2_0_6_6_2409382.JPG,tomatocheese,2,Oily,Fair,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,25-29,9
62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,3,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,2,"The only uses I have for this is when my skin is too irritated for chemical sunscreens, and when I&#039;m swimming outside on holiday e.g. the Mediterranean. It is a physical sunscreen with zinc &amp; titanium dioxide, which do leave a white cast on the skin. Using the recommended quarter teaspoon results in an ashy white film on the skin - it is NOT invisible at all. It also contains niacinamide, an ingredient I like very much, but the formula in this really lets it down. I cannot find a way to use this under my make-up that doesn&#039;t result in patchiness, settling into pores, and a strange film-like quality where I can see it coating all the fine vellus hairs on my face.  No make-up base, primer, or foundation I&#039;ve tried can counteract this, there&#039;s just this off-putting waxy effect of the sunscreen film and patchy uneven base on top. It is tremendously unflattering to say the least and will amplify the appearance of the most minute of dry skin flakes, making them super noticeable . For these reasons, I only use this when I&#039;m not wearing base make-up - while irritated skin is healing, and when I&#039;m swimming and exposed to strong sunlight. It is a functional physical sunscreen with good SPF50 protection in fairness, but its cosmetic effects are abysmal.

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,3,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,2,"I really don&#039;t like this sunscreen, and that makes me sad, because I normally love Cerave products.  I bought this because I wanted to try a sunscreen I could easily get in the US instead of having to order expensive Euro sunscreens online.  Avobenzone makes my face burn when I perspire, so I decided to get a physical-only sunscreen, and I chose this one due to my fondness for Cerave.  Well, the first time I applied it, my face looked a mess.  The sunscreen clung to every area of my face and it also left a terrible white cast on my very light skin.  I attributed it to the fact that my oily, thick skin was not well-exfoliated, so I put this product aside and hit the hydroxy acids and the Differin hard and got my skin to looking better and smoother.  Then I tried this product again.  It still looked awful and I looked like I was wearing a white mask.  Also, it stung.  I don&#039;t know what caused that, but I was surprised.  I will not buy this again.  I went ahead and ordered a highly-protective Euro chemical sunscreen (sans Avobenzone) from frenchcosmeticsforless.com and I will see how that goes.  In the meantime, I will use this Cerave product on my hands.

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,1,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,1,"Awful. I mean, sure, it probably shields your skin from harmful rays. BUT - it also applies in a thick, ghostly layer that never fully dries down. In my non-sunless tanner state I am pale (usually the lightest foundation color, or 2nd to lightest) and this made me just literally white. Not figuratively...literally. 

Takes time to dry down, and even when it does, it still sits on top of skin in a layer. Makeup does not sit nicely on top of this. Nope, it makes the foundation cakey and thick and blech. Stongly dislike this formula. 

Hoping I can return this. I tried it twice. It does not work for me at all. Would not even wear alone without foundation! Or on my body! 

Pros: available in drugstores, tube is handy and hygienic.
Cons: absolutely everything else. ",2018-07-02T14:22:00.000Z,3021644,thumb/h/145/2_0_6_6_2409382.JPG,nebbe,1,Normal,Fair,Neutral,Blond,Wavy,Fine,Gray,36-43,47

If you are not the color of a freshly disinterred corpse, this whitish cast might be too much.  I haven&#039;t experienced any issues with my sensitive skin, and this seems to do its job guarding against sun damage.

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,2,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,5,"Okay, okay - I&#039;m in the minority here as other reviewers totally hate this product, but for me, it works well.

I can&#039;t really use chemical sunscreens as they make my sensitive skin react.  Everything breaks me out and/or causes my rosacea to get even worse, so it&#039;s a double whammy as sun is no good for rosacea either.  On top of that, I&#039;ve started using a retinol product (MUAC .30% - great stuff BTW) so now I&#039;ve REALLY got to be careful with sun.

So here is how I get this Cerave mineral sunscreen to work for me: first off, I mix a pea-size dab of Embroylisse Lait-Creme with 2 drops of MUAC argan oil and apply that to my face and neck.  I let it sit a few minutes and then apply the Cerave, (AFTER SHAKING IT), working in small sections.   And yep, it does &quot;dry&quot; with a whitish film, which is the nature of the beast of zinc/TO sunscreens.  I have pale skin, so it&#039;s not that big a deal to me and it actually helps to even out all the red on my face AND I then apply a couple of layers of mineral makeup (Monave or Suncat) over that.   My makeup mostly looks great doing this (unfortunately, some of the worse of my &quot;fine lines&quot; are more noticeable, but again, I have layers of stuff on my face), and it holds up well until the night.  Granted I am pushing 60 and have dry skin (don&#039;t know how this would hold up with younger, oily skin), but as they say YMMV.  

Removing all of the layers is a 2 step process: first oil makeup remover (I like Silk Naturals) and then a face wash.  My skin feels good, not dry or tight, and all the stuff is removed.  

This product is not going to work well or many people, and lots of makeups are not going to work with it (thus people having issues with their makeup or sunscreen &quot;balling up&quot;). If you use mineral or powder makeup it works.  If you decide to give it a try, buy it from a store with a good return policy and keep the receipt. &quot;nuff said.

The white-cast is awful, it&#039;s thick and goopy, will not dry down...at all. This sunscreen will make your foundation cake up. I can not imagine wearing a full 1/4 tsp of this daily. Within minutes of applying 1/8th (just for testing) it felt like my face &quot;couldn&#039;t breathe&quot;. All the powder in the world could not set this formula to even a satin finish... it&#039;s pure grease.

My review is quite short but there&#039;s really nothing positive to note about this sunscreen other than I like that Cerave incorporated ceramides into the formula. Other than that... this is going in the trash.

The texsture is a liitle gritty too, not completely but there are some grits in there for whatever reason.
17$ is too much for such a poor texture.

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,5,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,2,"I wanted to love this stuff, I really did. I tried, too. But I hate it.

I can&#039;t really use chemical sunscreens because they make my skin itch and burn, and eventually make me break out. So, I was on the hunt for a good physical sunscreen after having no reaction to Maybelline&#039;s BB creme that had titanium dioxide as the sunscreen. I did some searching and finally found this, and I remembered how many good things I&#039;d heard about CeraVe over the years, so I bought it.

Big mistake. This stuff will not work for my skin. I have combination, sensitive, acne prone skin and this stuff either slides around when I try to put on my primer and foundation, or it pills up. It also makes my foundation (every kind I&#039;ve tried) look scaly and flaky from the start, then it oxidizes super fast so I look orange after an hour or two, even with foundations I never had that problem with when I didn&#039;t use this stuff.

I don&#039;t mind the white-ish film, because it honestly helps my foundation look more like my skin when it&#039;s first applied (I&#039;m super pale, so sometimes my foundations are like half a shade off without mixing in some white), but the feeling of it is so heavy and weird. It&#039;s like I have a clay mask on my face or something.

Basically, it&#039;s like this for me...

Pros:
Sunscreen
I didn&#039;t have an allergic reaction
I don&#039;t think it made me break out worse

Cons:
Feels so heavy
Never seems to dry properly
Does not spread easily
Does not dry clear
Makes my makeup apply horribly, even with primer

If I had an emergency need for facial sunscreen, and this was the only product available, I would use it. But I wouldn&#039;t be happy about it.",2016-04-03T16:14:00.000Z,2879932,thumb/h/145/2_0_6_6_2409382.JPG,WyllowL,5,Sensitive,Fair,Neutral,Blond,Straight,Fine,Green,25-29,99
62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,2,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,2,"Very disappointed. Allergic reaction of some sort. 

I recently purchased Cerave PM moisturizer and have been very happy with it - it calmed my seasonal eczema down. 

I&#039;ve been using sunscreen every morning for about 15 years now. Admittedly, LA Roche Posey is very good, but the price point for me is a bit high.

So was happy that Cerave had an offering with high spf. I don&#039;t even kind that it is white for a bit as a dermatologist has told me before that you need to apply a sufficient amount, almost that is all white on your face. 

Here are my pros and cons:

Pros:

High SPF
Price Point

Cons:

It does leave a film and my makeup does not go on well. I use a brush to apply foundation so I feel the stickiness when holding the brush, and see my fingerprints if I do not wash my hands before foundation application. 
Whatever it contains, it has caused my face to react and become rashy. I can&#039;t see it but can feel it. It is almost like it is very dry and my skin has started flaking. And it stings. 

Overall, would not recommend due to my reaction, and the fact it states it is hypoallergenic. ",2016-03-05T13:06:00.000Z,2871802,thumb/h/145/2_0_6_6_2409382.JPG,kaycee66,2,Sensitive,Fair,Unknown,Black,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,36-43,46

I have pretty fair skin, and the white cast is crazy.

Also, when I have dry skin this disaster turns into a catastrophe. White cast will not fade and flakes everywhere.

I love the Cera Ve cleansers and moisturizers bit this sunscreen is not good. The first time I used it I put a dime size amount in the palm of my hands and rubbed it between my fingers that&#039;s when I felt little gritty pills like things. Like there was a micro scrub in it. I thought maybe I used touch also I notice there was a white film (not to bad) on my face that people thought I was sick.the next day I put it on with a beauty blender. That left little scrubbies in my blender so I had to buy a new one. I thought maybe it was mixing with the aha&#039;s that I use so I experimented for a week. One day I used the cleanser and moisturizer then put on sunscreen still had the gritty sensation and the white cast. The next day I used a cleanser and the sunscreen still had the cast and you could really see it in my eyebrows. I&#039;m going to keep the product because I&#039;m not throwing it away at $12 a tube however I think I&#039;m only going to use it in the summer time at the pool that way is expected to have a white face.

Then it describes the product as a &quot;lightweight formula that spreads easily and dries with a clear finish.&quot; LIES. It&#039;s a very thick white cream that dries much too quickly as you try to spread it. Even when I try to work with it in small patches, it&#039;s almost impossible to avoid streaks. And once it dries, anything you do to fix the streaks will make it flake and look worse. What part of &quot;clear&quot; actually means opaque? If it had a clear finish, my husband wouldn&#039;t have said, &quot;Whoah you look like a geisha!&quot; the moment he saw me with this on. The package also says, &quot;May also reduce skin redness.&quot; Well yes, it may happen to reduce redness, as it also reduces any other color on your face, including your actual skin color, to pasty whiteness. 

I tried applying it to bare skin and putting makeup over it to put some color back in my face. But unless I caked foundation and bronzer over, you could still see the streaks. Plus it felt like I was wearing a mask. I tried mixing it with my foundation, to make a tinted sunscreen. I still came out looking several shades whiter. I tried putting on less, but then I was sacrificing protection and it was still hard to spread and streaky.  

There are some pros, to be fair. It&#039;s fragrance free and didn&#039;t irritate my sensitive skin. And I have no doubt that it really does provide the protection it claims. But I will only be wearing it when I go out for a run, or other outdoor sports, when I don&#039;t care what I look like. For a more expensive sunscreen, it&#039;s really disappointing. It finally spurred me to order some Asian sunscreens from Amazon, because it seems that the Asian brands actually know how to make highly protective sunscreens that you won&#039;t hate wearing.

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,3,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,1,"Like most everyone else, I bought this because Cerave has such a great reputation with products.  Most surprisingly and unfortunately, this one did not live up to their reputation.

Before this, I was using a natural body sunscreen with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide that was thick, tough to spread, and left my face patchy.  I didn&#039;t fault the product much for that because it didn&#039;t say it was intended for face.  Well, this Cerave lotion specifically intended for the face gave me just as much trouble as using a thick body sunscreen.  This was thick and wouldn&#039;t spread over more than a centimeter of skin per dollop, it seemed like, while leaving a white cast.  Trying to spread it further and rub it in to deplete the whiteness only caused my face to flake, an awful look with no fix. This was with using moisturizer prior to application. For comparison, I also recently got a super cheap travel size Kiss My Face sunscreen that goes on smoothly.

This was a higher-priced drugstore item and not at all worth the money to me, because I&#039;m already dreading having to use it up, considering it makes my face so flaky.

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,5,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,2,"I have been really interested in trying CeraVe&#039;s sunscreen because of the &quot;Invisible Zinc&quot; claim, but unfortunately this product has one of the worst white casts I have ever seen. Previously I&#039;ve used all-physical sunscreens with white casts and I don&#039;t mind them too much; in some cases they even help even out my skin tone and conceal acne scars. However, this white cast is so egregious on my medium skin tone I look like I&#039;m auditioning for kabuki with a complete white face. It said it &quot;dries clear&quot; so I waited hours, and it only got worse as it started to flake off some of my dry patches and along my hair line.   

I did like how easy it was to spread on and the ingredients (ceramides and niacinamide), but I was definitely expecting something more moisturizing since they advertise this as a &quot;face lotion.&quot; On my dehydrated-normal acne-prone skin, it exacerbated my flakiness and dry patches along with caking up on any acne and making it a lot more noticeable (and this was with moisturizer underneath too). It also has a sort of stale powdery scent upon application.  

Overall, this product completely failed to meet the expectations set forth by the &quot;invisible zinc&quot; claim on its packaging and I won&#039;t purchase or recommend in the future. If this weren&#039;t a sample, it would be going straight back to the store. 

Edit: 12/26/14 - It&#039;s worth mentioning that the SPF 50 body sunscreen from CeraVe is nearly identical in ingredients, the only difference is the omission of niacinamide. I&#039;ve tried both and find them indiscernible. If niacinamide isn&#039;t a major draw and this sunscreen works for you, the body sunscreen is only $1-2 more for 3 oz (instead of the 2 oz for the face sunscreen).

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,2,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,3,"I really wanted to like this. CeraVe AM Lotion with SPF 30 worked for me for a long time until I developed a sensitivity to chemical sunscreens. I was waiting for a product from CeraVe that was mineral-based and, preferably, paraben-free. 

Pros:
- Has a dry finish
- Dispenser is way better than the AM/PM lotions

Cons:
- Does NOT moisturize nearly enough. AM SPF 30 is formulated with hyaluronic acid, and I&#039;m not sure why that wasn&#039;t included in the SPF 50. I also know mineral sunscreens can be more drying, and I should note that this product does not purport to be a moisturizer the way the Facial Moisturizing Lotion does, so I probably should have been more cognizant of that.
- It left an awful white cast along the perimeter of my face...it just got flaky and gross and clumped off.

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,2,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,5,"This is my new favorite high-SPF face sunscreen. I mix this with Paula&#039;s Choice Resist Super-Light Daily Defense SPF 30 sunscreen, which has a slight tint and tons of antioxidants, but is also really pricey. I wear this combination on my face 365 days a year. By combining these products each day, I get a higher SPF along with the sheer tint and anti-aging ingredients in the Paula&#039;s Choice product. 

The biggest selling point for me is that this CeraVe SPF lotion is fragrance-free -- I cannot stand the &quot;sunscreen smell&quot; and this lotion doesn&#039;t smell like anything to me. I also like the texture of the CeraVe lotion; the high-SPF factor; its blendability; the fact that it is a mineral sunscreen with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide; and it has some skin-beneficial ingredients like niacinimide. Paula&#039;s Choice Beautypedia says that it has a preservative that can be problematic for sensitive skin. I have noticed a little bit of acne since I started using it, but overall it&#039;s pretty good. 

Before I found the CeraVe SPF lotion, I used Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 50 Sensitive Skin until I couldn&#039;t find it at the drugstore. The CeraVe lotion seems to provide better coverage and has a better texture than the Neutrogena.

It&#039;s got a weird powdery flaky finish too. UGH UGH UGH. WTH it says INVISIBLE ZINC. I just had to scrub it off my face because it sticks to your skin.

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,11,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,4,"Reviewers who are displeased with this sunscreen probably have not ventured into the world of European high PPD sunscreens - which are often thick, tacky, greasy, and streaky in addition to leaving a white cast. After trying a couple of those, I immediately ran towards Asian milk sunscreens, which are a dream. They are very cosmetically elegant and suitable for oilier skins. The only problem I have with my Asian milk sunscreens are: 1) primarily, ease of purchasing - ordering overseas is a drag 2) most of the ones I like run from $10-15 per oz (factoring in shipping) which isn&#039;t terrible, but I&#039;d like something cheaper for an everyday sunscreen 3) the milk texture is great, but often makes it really hard to apply enough product!

This Cerave sunscreen pretty much fixes all those problems - 1) it can be bought in US drugstores 2) runs ~$7 per oz (less if it goes on sale) at $14/2 oz 3) I find that the thicker texture makes it easier to apply a good amount. I probably still don&#039;t apply the &quot;proper&quot; amount, but I can get more on than when I use a milk. 

So first off I want to emphasize that this is a very protective, all-physical sunscreen. I prefer to only use physical actives, especially for an everyday sunscreen. To get to an SPF50 from only physical actives is not easy, so this should be quite UVA protective as well (PPD should be 8-10, probably higher). Is this the most elegant sunscreen I have used? Nope, the finish is still a bit tacky, and it creases a little on my forehead, which is the oiliest part of my face. The white cast is significant, but it looks fine with a touch of foundation powder. All-physical sunscreens will pretty much always leave a white cast (if they aren&#039;t sold with a tint), and are often quite greasy to boot, so I am actually quite happy with the finish of this one. And, as mentioned, it&#039;s pretty economical. Tube packaging is easy to use, as well. 

For reference my skin type is normal/combo with a tendency towards dehydration, sometimes sensitive, very clog prone. I would recommend this sunscreen for dry to normal skin types; as mentioned earlier, this may pool/crease on oily skin. Very dry skins will probably have to moisturize first. Have not tested its water resistance yet, but I do remove at night with a cleansing oil. The ingredients seem free of big cloggers, will update in a few weeks on breakout situation. 

Bottom line: This will leave a white cast (easily remedied with a touch of powder), but is otherwise a fine everyday sunscreen for normal to dry skin that provides highly efficient, all-physical active ingredients.

It&#039;s ghostly white. I got it because &quot;InStyle&quot; featured it in their &quot;Best of Beauty&quot; issue as a great product... One of &quot;The best&quot;, so to speak. Well, at least I know they don&#039;t choose those products because they&#039;re truly the best. Won&#039;t make that mistake again. I wouldn&#039;t have such a problem with the white cast if Cerave didn&#039;t specifically market this as being invisible! It&#039;s like lying straight to the consumer&#039;s face. There&#039;s just no way to mistake this product for &quot;invisible&quot;. Unless they&#039;re only testing their products on albinos.

I rubbed and rubbed and it still came out white. Also, the matte-ness makes it cling to dry patches and gave the face a strange, unnatural over-powdered look. Funny, because InStyle featured this in the &quot;best for dry skin&quot; category... If anything, this may be good for those with shiny skin! The white-ness showed through my foundation.

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,1,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,2,"Hmm.  The formula is definitely nice and non-irritating, and my skin feels soft where I&#039;ve applied this sunscreen.  Unfortunately, it is cosmetically unwearable even at just 1/4 the amount needed to get the full SPF.  I am very pale and this left a glaring white cast on my face and many white smudges around my features and hairline despite very careful application.  There is nothing &quot;invisible&quot; about the zinc in this product, and while it is definitely smoother than physical sunblocks from the past, most people who use the proper amount of this sunblock will find it too chalky to wear anywhere but the beach.  Even then, it&#039;s up for debate.  I applied roughly 1/8 teaspoon to my face, neck, and ears - this is roughly a quarter of how much sunblock one should actually be using for that area - and while the product applied smoothly and did not sting, after two hours on my face the white cast seems to have worsened rather than improved.  

I will not throw this sunscreen out, as it was kind of expensive, but I&#039;ll probably reserve it for touching up protection on my nose and ears when I&#039;m at the beach this summer.

I do like that this is a typical squeeze tube and not a tub though for sanitary reasons. This claims to be formulated with invisible zinc. I&#039;m not sure that such a thing exists but Ocean Potion goes on much clearer. This is medium weight and requires a ton of blending if you were to wear it alone and will still leave you white faced. I like to add a drop of Argan or facial oil for moisture and easier blending and a drop of foundation or concealer that&#039;s several shades darker than my skin tone to create a custom tinted sunscreen. No white face and decent coverage for everyday wear.

It is my own fault for not listening to other reviews , but this is terrible. It leaves a very noticeable white cast that  does not blend well and rubs everywhere.  Is there fall out? there is fall out galore ! Ugh . 
The formula is a mixed bag:They include benzyl alcohol close up top on the list and, Methylisothiazoline-- two irritants one of  which is not recommended for leave in products. The only good things about this formulation is it has three antioxidants and  two possible skin cell communicators including Niacinimide and retinal palmitate. They admittedly did a good job of adding in oatmeal as an anti-irritant , some ceramides as skin identical ingredients, and a tiny bit of humectants. 
 &#039;CeraVe&#039; usually does a good job, and I had high expectations for this sunscreen, but it&#039;s back to the drawing board  I know &#039;CeraVe&#039; can do better.

I  am being generous and giving it a 2, it is matte and not greasy at all.  unfortunately you won&#039;t be able to wear this outdoors where people can see you.

I do not like this product at all because, although the package claims &quot;invisible zinc&quot;, it is not invisible and left my face looking ghostly pale.  This product also made my face very dry looking.  I put my usual lightweight foundation on top of it and that was a mistake because it turned my face very white, dry and cakey.  Three things that I don&#039;t want my face to look like.  I will return to Walmart and get my $13.47 (for 2 oz.) refunded.

Any lotions or foundations that contain traditional sunscreens tend to break my face out and I hate the sunscreen smell. But having a previous melanoma on my face, I&#039;m under strict &quot;wear sunscreen at all times&quot; orders. This sunscreen finally does exactly what I need perfectly. 

It has no odor and it does not break out my skin. I could cheer I&#039;m so happy.

Some people indicate that it is gloopy and leaves a white film. It can if you splat a bunch in your palm and just smear it on. If I&#039;m wearing it alone, I do small areas at the time and it blends in quite well. What I normally do, however, is mix it with my foundation in the palm of my hand first (I get the foundation a shade darker than I want so I can mix it with the sunscreen or standard lotion and have it come out the shade I want) and then spread that on my face. It works a charm.",2013-05-08T11:56:00.000Z,2488951,thumb/h/145/2_0_6_6_2409382.JPG,windyp,8,Combination,Fair,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,36-43,1

Though a lot of people are saying that it goes on ghostly white...it could but what I do, since it is thick, I do a little at a time and I don&#039;t look white at all. Then it will soak in and not look white. Also, when they say oil-free they meant it-that&#039;s why I think it&#039;s so hard to spread of your face, and is the reason why I do it in sections with a little at a time. I don&#039;t need powder on top of this, it goes on so oil-free that I don&#039;t shine all day, even atfter reapplying it in the middle of the day. It literally keeps me shine free. But remember iF you try this, you have to do it in sections, so little sunscreen dots on your forehead, cheeks, chin,and nose, then gently rub it in. If you take a big heap of it you will definitely turn white without a doubt. After you rub it in, you can do it again depending on how much you want. The reviewers that gave this a terrible review probably rubbed alot at one time. But this is a truly amazing sunscreen that is effective, keeps my skin feeling and looking great, and is only $15. Please try It, and take my advice too...it will change your view on it. I promise. it&#039;s amazing!",2013-05-05T03:45:00.000Z,2487303,thumb/h/145/2_0_6_6_2409382.JPG,247swimchick9,4,Acne-prone,Fair-Medium,Not Sure,Brunette,Other,Other,Blue,19-24,73

However, it is not at all as advertised -- goes on white and thick and is difficult to blend in.  It also balls up if you keep rubbing or try to put makeup over it.  I felt it was such a bad product that I couldn&#039;t even use it on my body, so I returned it.

If you are hoping to wear this under make up...DON&#039;T.  It won&#039;t work for you that way.  This is a bare face product (but I do have to put some of MAC F&amp;B over it to deflect the white cast.


PROS:
*If you are looking for a non-irritating sunscreen for the face, this may be a contender...but this is for those days you are going to be outside all day and wouldn&#039;t think about wearing makeup.  
*Zinc sunscreen
*I can use it, but I don&#039;t know if I will use it for anything more than those all day outside outings. 



CONS
*Invisible Zinc my butt!  For me it blended fine, but there was a ghostly white cast
*I had a freak out after wearing it two hours.  I looked at myself in a close up mirror and I felt like it was &quot;gathering&quot; in my lines/wrinkles.
*I don&#039;t feel comfortable with it on.  I definitely feel like I have to wash my face ASAP.

I gave it a 3 because it doesn&#039;t burn or irritate my skin and I can use it on my body if need be or give it to my  husband.  But this is not what I was looking for to wear under makeup and up my SPF protection at the same time.",2013-04-29T07:42:00.000Z,2484157,thumb/h/145/2_0_6_6_2409382.JPG,1017,1,Sensitive,Fair-Medium,Neutral,Brunette,Wavy,Fine,Brown,36-43,1194

I tried it for the first time today and can&#039;t believe what it looks like after only 5 hours. I have a definite white cast and it has collected in every single &quot;crease&quot; or mini wrinkle on my chest and neck so I have white lines all over.

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,0,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,2,"I tried this recently as I have very oily, acne prone skin and PIH problems.  I used this for about 5 days straight.  It does NOT go on invisibly.  It goes on white, sticky, and hard to spread.  It does dry down to a more clear color, but it is by no means invisible.  I still had a definite white cast.  The worst part, though, was that my skin started peeling like crazy!  Some said it was the ss drying up and peeling off like dried Elmers glue.  It looked and felt like my skin was peeling off in large patches.  I looked like I had some skin disease.  I swear the flakes were so bad it looked like I had white ruffles around my mouth at one point.  I was very surprised, as the Cerave AM lotion w/ spf30 is NOTHING like this - it spreads easily, sinks right in and disappears completely, w/ no flaking whatsoever.  And I have very oily skin!  Very disappointing.  I can&#039;t say I&#039;ll buy this again.  The irregular flaking patches, peeling, and white cast are just too much.  As far as effectiveness, it did not break me out and did protect from the sun quite well (at least in those areas where it and my skin did not peel/flake off).

62,1622,CeraVe,22,Sunscreen,2,160671,Sunscreen Face Lotion SPF 50,4,"I have been on a quest for years to find a drugstore-priced sunscreen that doesn&#039;t break me out, and while it&#039;s not perfect, this is the ONLY ONE that has worked for me. As it turns out, I am sensitive to chemical sunscreens (previous contenders included ingredients like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, and Helioplex). My skin would feel oily and greasy from the moment I put it on, and within hours I would start breaking out. My last attempt, with an Oil of Olay antiaging + sunscreen lotion, gave me two painful cysts on my chin that were there for weeks. I only used it twice before giving up.

After that, I sought some advice, and was told that I was probably sensitive to chemical sunscreens and to look for one that only contained physical sunscreens (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide). There are several higher-end products that contain only these, but I was looking for something in a lower price range. I spotted this at my local drugstore, read the ingredients, and snapped it up.

The bad: It doesn&#039;t apply very smoothly (would probably go on a little better on freshly washed, moisturized skin) and despite having InvisibleZinc it does leave a whitish cast. I get around that by using a very light application of bronzer, and that helps.

The good: It has not broken me out, at all. Not even once. It even seems to leave my skin with a more matte finish, which is a relief after the sunscreens that left me looking like an oil slick. It&#039;s well priced and is readily available, which is very important to me for a product I use everyday.

It could be better, but I&#039;m just happy to have found something that works!",2013-04-09T21:51:00.000Z,2473048,thumb/h/145/2_0_6_6_2409382.JPG,violetfairygirl,2,Acne-prone,Fair,Warm,Black,Wavy,Medium,Brown,30-35,79

I have used other mineral based sunscreens, so I know they are usually more difficult to apply than regular chemical sunscreen and can often leave a white cast on skin, but I must admit.... this is the worst mineral sunscreen I have tried! It leaves a very heavy white cast and is extremely difficult to work into the skin. I think the worst thing though is the heavy feeling it leaves on my face which is uncomfortable. It is nothing like the CeraVe AM SPF 30 lotion in the pump bottle which is very light (yet not water/sweat resistant for hot summer days).

This product gets it (mostly) right. It is slightly tacky, and takes a bit to absorb, but it doesn&#039;t leave me looking like an oil slick. It also doesn&#039;t make me look pasty white. It does lighten my skin some, but I&#039;m okay with that, since I have fair/light skin anyway. 

I can&#039;t say how it wears with foundation over top, since I don&#039;t normally wear it anyway. 

If you&#039;re like me and have been struggling to find a sunscreen with high spf that doesn&#039;t irritate your sensitive skin or coat your face with grease, this is worth a try!
