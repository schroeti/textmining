156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,3,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,5,"This SPF is great! I had been on the hunt for a good SPF for months, if not years. Previously I used the Tarte Tarteguard SPF, it was ok but it had a strong scent and made me too dewy. This one checks all my boxes, it&#039;s light, does not break me out, unscented, high enough SPF, doesn&#039;t make me overly dewy, or overly matte, wears well under makeup, is moisturizing, and has added skincare benefits!

I have combination skin and strangely this seems to make the oily parts oilier and the normal ones drier, not sure how or why.
I sticked to it due to the consistency and overall airbrushed look that I got from it. Am not sure I&#039;m going to repurchase, tho. I&#039;ve gotten into my Korean/Japanese skincare phase and they seem to have a wider range/more alternatives.

156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,5,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,5,"This is absolutely the best PC SPF moisturizer for oily and combo skin. Maybe normal to dry skin too if you are using moisturizing serums or boosters under it.
Due to my laziness, I thought PC&#039;s only mineral SPF sunscreens were the Calm Redness Relief ones. The truth is PC has 4 mineral sunscreens:  This Resist Super light wrinkled defense, Calm Redness normal to oily, Calm redness normal to dry, and the new Essential Glow defense red one.
I first tried the Calm Redness relief ones. The normal to dry felt great and was very moisturizing, but often left a greasy look on my face that would take hours to fade. After 3-4 hours it was perfect, but the initial greasiness was unpleasant. The calm normal to oily was fine except it left a horrible white cast, even hours later.
However, the super light daily wrinkle defense does it just right. It is a totally matte finish, but not drying. The tint covers imperfections but it doesn&#039;t feel like makeup.

156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,2,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,4,"It was a bit of a journey for me with this one. The first time I tried it it dried my skin and oxidized my mineral powder foundation and turned my face orange. So if you use heavy-ish foundation that will probably be an issue with this moisturizer. 

I am very very acne prone and surprisingly I had no problems with this silicone-full formula, which encouraged me to look for ways to use the product. The ultimate solution was to use an Asian-style toner/lotion like Hada Labo first (plus a doze of mist) and seal it with this moisturizer. This left my skin both hydrated and protected throughout the day. I don&#039;t use foundation any more, just some concealer and light powder on top and this way makeup oxidization in not an issue any more. The ultimate test will be how this product fares in cold windy winter. 
PS. I use this moisturizer and the Hada Labo lotion around my eyes as well instead of a separate eye cream and the results are amazing: concealer doesn&#039;t crease as much and my milia was also reduced.

156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,4,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,5,"My HG moisturiser with SPF! I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin. This is the only SPF that doesn&#039;t break me out or adds to my oiliness during the day because of its super light formula. The package is a simple squeeze tube, nice to travel with but nothing fancy. The only downside is that you can&#039;t see how much is left. I really don&#039;t want to go without, so I always have a backup. It has a very sheer tint (beige) to it, so you have to shake it before use. I think so the pigment is distributed well through the formula. I am a NW15-20 in Mac and it suits my skin tone perfectly, I honestly don&#039;t even see it on my face. However, if you are much lighter or darker, it might leave a dark or white cast. The smell is okay, kind of nutty, but it disappears upon application. I choose this because it is a physical sunscreen, whithout any nasty filters like oxybenzone. Makeup applies nicely on top, no pilling or slipping. It doesn&#039;t feel heavy or sticky, but I do always set my face after makeup with a powder.
I have never been burned when wearing this, but I prevent getting my face for a prolonged time in the sun anyway. It is kind of pricey, but good SPF is the cornerstone of any skincare regiment so I don&#039;t mind paying a bit extra. Will continually rebuy for I have not find a better (or similar!) replacement and don&#039;t expect to find it anytime soon. SPF30 without &#039;bad&#039; filters, alchohol or other irritating ingredients is rare, so I stick with my favorite!

A &quot;shake-well&quot; formula, a thin fluid that is quite easy to spread. The consistency is fine, but my problem  is that it feel like it sits on the top of the skin.... I guess all mineral sunscreens do that, but you don&#039;t always &quot;feel&quot; them. When i touch the face i can feel it&#039;s there... 

It also gives that typical mineral look after a while - just as mineral makeup can do especially on scarred and blemished skin - a floating tinted residue....

It contains a lot of silicones- on a normal/mixed skin I think this could work perfectly as a primer under makeup.  My skin usually breaks out by silicones so I didn&#039;t care to use the whole tube up.

I gave this a good chance, and used it for about a month before I got fed up with the following issues:

1. The product separates quickly - every time I squeezed some out of the tube, the oily liquid would come out first
2. It doesn&#039;t moisturise at all, yet it felt rather oily when applying. I have combination skin and need moisture on my cheeks. My cheeks were so dry that they felt itchy. It was summer when I used this
3. It is cakey for a tinted moisturiser. I use Benefit Pore-fessional for my primer and this did not work well with my primer
4. It wasn&#039;t mattifying. I much prefer my usual moisturiser (Murad Oil-Control Mattifier SPF 15+)

156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,4,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,3,"EDIT 3-9-17: Ended up returning. Just couldn&#039;t get over the caking and discovered it was causing red welts and itching. I&#039;ve NEVER had luck with any physical sunscreens and keep falling for the idea they are better for sensitive skin. Not Me. I will continue search for gentle, chemical sunscreen!

Pros:
- I&#039;m about NW20-ish and the tint is perfect but very very sheer. Really all it does for me at least is &quot;blur&quot; out my skin but that&#039;s to be expected 
- keeps my oily skin nice and matte for a reasonable length of time
- very easy on my sensitive skin. No breakouts or redness flare-ups
Cons:
- impossible to wear concealer or powder foundation over it! It does a really weird thing to even the tiniest spot concealing-like it sucks it up or something
- tried a couple of different powder foundations (MUFE and Shiseido) and even applied as lightly as humanly possible they looked awful and caked very badly. Only thing that added any coverage was to very lightly dust LM loose powder over.

I will not repurchase but keep to wear in yard, golf course, beach, etc. I think if it was more of a liquid and less of a cream it might work under makeup. If I didn&#039;t want to add any concealer or foundation at all it would be pretty great.",2017-02-19T22:24:00.000Z,2947620,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,bumblebee770,4,Oily,Fair,Cool,Blond,Other,Other,Brown,44-55,102

It&#039;s about time!  I am sent and I order samples all the time because I have my esthetics license.  I&#039;ve tried everything from Oil of Olay to Clinique, from Skinceuticals to SkinMedica, and Andalou Naturals to Jane Iredale, and even a few Japanese sunscreens I ordered straight from Japan (on Amazon).....just to give an idea of the many diverse brands I&#039;ve tried.  I&#039;m 47 years old, and my skin is (still) extremely oily (thanks menopause!), clog and acne prone, sensitive, can easily flake, and it&#039;s very pale.  I love how light this feels on my skin, and how it&#039;s tinted, which helps prevent white casting.  The tint is enough to even out my pale skin tone (blends in beautifully), and I add a bit of powder and gloss for a very casual daytime &#039;my skin but better&#039; look.  It wears beautifully under powdered mineral makeup or when I use a foundation stick.  While it doesn&#039;t control oil, it certainly does not add any or feel at all greasy and heavy on my skin.  I should have written this review a couple of years ago, but I still wanted to see what was out there.  Physical sunscreen protection is one of the best products to care for your skin to maintain it&#039;s youth and prevent photo damage.  Sunscreen also protects your investments in skin products and treatments.  When I&#039;m asked what is the one product I need to prevent wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, my answer is always sunscreen.  This is a full spectrum UVA/UVB, physical sunscreen.  EWG rates this as an overall 1.  
You can order samples for a very small fee...I suggest ordering a few to try it out for at least a few days...which is how I prefer to try out new products for myself as well as for my clients.

I consider my skin to be essentially neutral undertoned (with very very slight yellow tint) and medium in color (as in, medium on the global scale of skin color, not medium for Caucasian skin). That puts me at about a less yellow NC40-42. This sunscreen is wayyyy too pink and pale if you&#039;re as dark or darker than myself. And because you really should use 1/4 tsp to get the full protection, it looks absurd. Not as bad as a pure white cast, but still kind of odd and dull. I also have oily skin and this does NOT sit well through the day. It ends up looking kind of pasty by the end of the day and my skin looks greasier than if I use something like Trader Joe&#039;s Enrich SPF 15. It&#039;s pretty nonirritating, however, so if you&#039;re somewhere around NC20-30, you could probably get away with this and it&#039;s nice to use only physical sunscreen filters.

For years, I&#039;ve been looking for a good moisturizer with proper spf, but all the moisturizers with SPF or face sunscreens have broken me out or been too oily. I have combination skin that can get really oily from the T-zone with wrong moisturizer. However, this moisturizer actually mattifies my face and slightly tightens pores on my cheeks.

The moisturizer is tinted so it doesn&#039;t leave any whitecast. The colour works pretty well with my skintone (NC15, EL 1N1), but the pink undertones clash slightly with my neutral skin. Therefore, I use the product only under makeup. 

The scent of the moisturizer is the only drawback. The product is supposed to be fragrance free, but it has a chemical smell. It&#039;s pretty strong and seems to attract insects in the summer, which is annoying. However, the scent hasn&#039;t given me any irritation. I have repurchased the product since it keeps my skin in good condition.",2016-11-18T15:20:00.000Z,2929556,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,LagoBlu13,2,Combination,Fair,Neutral,Brunette,Wavy,Fine,Blue,25-29,86
156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,3,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,5,"This is a tinted spf mattifying moisturizer.  The tint looks too dark for me as I am quite fair but it blends out and I can&#039;t even tell it&#039;s on.  
The sunscreen has been good, no sensitivity. It doesn&#039;t make me itch.  It does not have a white cast. It does not smell like sunscreen.  I am very breakout prone and I&#039;ve never broken out from this.  The cream is a medium thickness and smooths on beautifully and works under makeup.  
 It does help me control oil. I&#039;m more of a combo but if I don&#039;t wear anything mattifying on my face, I can&#039;t handel how oily my face is at the end of the day.  But I&#039;ve never been a blotter so I&#039;m not THAT oily.  I have gone through 2 tubes (one tube lasts me close to a year of daily use)  of the this and am quite pleased with it.  I feel the price point is fair, especially if you wait for 20% off which happens frequently.  I kind of want to try something different the next time I run out, but I always come back to this because finding a mattifying spf moisturizer is tough.  Also, I do not use  primers under makeup.  Just this.  Primers usually make me oily or do nothing for me. My makeup lays just fine over this. Lately I&#039;ve had issues with flaky dry patches which I think is from some lactic exfoliation I&#039;ve been using and my foundation hasn&#039;t worn very well. So I definitely wouldn&#039;t recommend this moisturizer if you have dry patches.",2016-10-30T08:23:00.000Z,2926224,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,Tygerlilee84,4,Acne-prone,Fair,Neutral,Red,Wavy,Other,Brown,30-35,541

Initially I used it during winter and it was too drying and mattifying on my combo skin without any moisturizer underneath. I tried it in summer at a tropical country and I would say I&#039;ve found the best physical sunscreen that won&#039;t sensitize my eye and nose area nor does it melt/sweat off your skin. I get a bit of a glow in the tropics around the afternoon but why not show of that glowing skin? The tint is a bit too pink for my NC20 skin but the color disappears after a while. This sunscreen smooths over my pores and make them look smaller. It has little to no coverage. The only down side is that after applying this sunscreen, when I use MUFE waterproof concealer on my blemishes, it doesn&#039;t apply well. The product moves around a bit during application. But when you leave it for a second, it becomes dry and it sets. This sunscreen is my everyday tinted moisturizer with SPF. I&#039;m trying to mix it in with my other physical sunscreen and some foundation to set off the tint and its been working. Try out different combinations if it doesn&#039;t work for you but you want to give it a try. I only wish they make it in different tints. PC always has sales going on, so if you wait a bit, you can get it cheaper. Cheers!

156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,0,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,3,"Hopefully I had a sample before purchasing it. It&#039;s too matifiying for me. I could see little lines on my face that I won&#039;t see with any other moisturizer (and don&#039;t forget this tends to be a moisturizer, and not a bb cream!) and my face felt a little bit dry. Also, my eyelids got really sticky when I closed my eyes...

This product is a good choice if you are avoiding chemicals uv filters (and also if you avoid that white cast of mineral sunscreens). But it didn&#039;t work for me... I wish I like it because it has really good ingredients.

If you have oily skin, you may like it!",2016-09-10T06:20:00.000Z,2916779,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,Paul8900,0,Combination,Fair-Medium,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,25-29,1
156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,2,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,5,"Best Daytime Eyelid Cream for extremely oily lids.

Some background on my eyelids.  They get super oily/sebumy.  You know what breaks down water proof makeup?  Oil.  So, waterproof formulas only work for me when I&#039;m sweating, and my eyelids natural oil production breaks down such formulas.  Eyelid primers such as Milani or UDPP don&#039;t work for me.  Too Faced works a little better.  Nyx waterproof is my favorite drugstore and Nars Smudgeproof is my HG.
I like using a lot of SPF during the day, layering SPF makeup over my regular SPF.

Around my eyes, I prefer mineral/physical titanium dioxide or zinc oxide because it doesn&#039;t sting.  *Fun fact:  zinc oxide offers a wee bit better UVA protection*.  

Most formulas are too moist on my eyelid and make my eye makeup slick off.  Even on non-makeup days, I feel any SPF is slicking off and not offering any protection.

This however, keeps my eyelid and lower lashline matte and protected with no stinging at all.

By itself, this works extremely well as an eyelid primer but I use Benefit Air Patrol just to have a base especially for use on eyelids.  Thanks to this, I no longer have to use Air Patrol too close to my lashline, where it tends to sting a bit.  By itself, its smooth and keeps eyeshadow lasting but doesn&#039;t quite help eyeshadow &quot;popping&quot; or looking improved on me.

The tint isn&#039;t too noticeable on my ochre NC30 skintone, especially when I cover up with makeup, though it is a more neutral-toned than my skin.

On non-makeup days, this works really well and feels like it&#039;s not going anywhere.  On active days, it layers really well on top of itself without feeling heavy.

If you have smaller, extremely oily and sensitive areas, I really recommend this as a daytime cream.  If you have really oily and sensitive skin all over your face, I think there are cheaper options out there like from Neutrogena Healthy Defense SPF 50 or Coppertone Oil-Free SPF 30.  Since I use this as a daytime eye cream, a little goes a long way.

Either way, the ingredient list is beautiful and the price is pretty justifiable, especially when there are sales or coupon codes.  If you have issues with SPF and oil production, I&#039;d give this a go.",2016-08-27T07:03:00.000Z,2913918,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,acciohashi,2,Combination,Olive,Warm,Brunette,Straight,Other,Brown,Under 18,64
156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,1,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,4,"I suppose this is the closest I will get to strongly liking a Paula&#039;s Choice product. I&#039;ve tried a bunch, this was my favorite.

Despite following the 1/4 tsp rule &amp; avoiding the sun; I still wish this was SPF 50 rather than SPF 30. The price is pretty steep too because I pay about half for better protection from Asian brands. HOWEVER with my Rosacea, I began growing paranoid about what chemical UV filters could be doing to my skin. So I decided to search some more options. This P.C sunscreen is strictly zinc oxide (meaning physical UV filters). Zinc Oxide tends to be gentler on sensitive skin.

Paula&#039;s Choice RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense sunscreen is tinted. I am extremely pale leaning neutral. I match with MAC&#039;s NC10 at my darkest. This sunscreen is WAY too dark for me. It&#039;s about NW15-20. Initially I was either going to throw it away or save it for spray tans.  Recently I read about pale girls wearing too-dark tinted sunscreen under their foundation &amp; I was inspired to try this. My favorite foundation is super full coverage. It had no trouble covering this, because the coverage of the tint in the sunscreen is sheer. Perfect. ***If you are wondering why so many companies ruin formulations of physical SS by adding a tint, it&#039;s to avoid whitecast***

The antioxidants in this product should help boost the sun protection efficiency. I like that this was moisturizing enough to smooth out flakes &amp; help my foundation glide on. It isn&#039;t thick, nor greasy.  But what I liked more than that, was it dried to a demi-matte finish. I&#039;ve always said that a good sunscreen is a good primer.

All in all this is a decent sunscreen. Now that I&#039;ve worked past the god awful tint issue I&#039;ll probably repurchase. ",2016-08-18T21:39:00.000Z,2912113,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,MUAsAlbino,2,Very Oily,Fair,Neutral,Blond,Wavy,Fine,Green,25-29,513
156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,4,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,4,"I really like this sunscreen! I have oily-combo skin and was looking for a matte-finish, but non drying facial sunscreen. This has a universal tint which works well with my skin, and adds the slightest hint of coverage. My skin is oily enough for me to wear this alone (without moisturizer), and it works well with some concealer on top and a light dusting of powder. It keeps me pretty matte all day and I barely need to touch up. 

However, I have tried wearing this by itself with foundation on top, and my skin got uncomfortably dry. If you are a foundation user, make sure to put on lotion underneath. I find that the mattifying effect doesn&#039;t work as well with moisturizer under, so play around with it and find what routine works best for you. I&#039;ve been using it for 2-3 weeks and it hasn&#039;t broken me out or irritated my skin.

My only concern with this is the price - it is $32 USD and I live in Canada, so the conversion rates are a little ridiculous. Plus they tack on a $5.00 brokerage fee to each order, so I end up paying around $50+CAD for a bottle of this. I think I would only repurchase if there was a good sale.

I have to be very very very careful what I put on my face.  This is bonifide safe for your face if you have acne prone skin (at least mine and I try a lot).

Finally - an all mineral tinted sunscreen that isn&#039;t yellow, but truly neutral leaning almost cool. Not all of us are yellow based, and the other tinted sunscreens I&#039;ve tried - Cotz face natural skintone, Replenix Ultimatte, MD Solar Sciences - are all very yellow, and mostly dry too dark. This one almost seems too light going on, but then seems to adjust to my skin tone as it dries down - and I&#039;m not super pale.  I have dry skin, so I wear a  moisturizer under this, along with a layer of dedicated sunscreen if I&#039;m spending time outside. My skin feels moist all day without being greasy, and looks flawless with a dab of concealer around nose &amp; mouth. This product has 13% zinc oxide, and loads of antioxidants as well, so I feel like I&#039;m doing my skin a favor just applying this. It lasts all day for me and never seems to break down or separate around my nose, where I can sometimes get oily by the end of the day, especially in warm weather. Yeah, I wish it was less expensive. But Paula&#039;s Choice has very frequent sales, and I plan to just buy 2 tubes at a time whenever I can save money on it. As far as breakouts go, you&#039;ll have them if you don&#039;t remove this thoroughly. I cleanse with oil every single night, to completely remove everything I put on my face, plus any dirt, sweat, and pollutants I&#039;ve accumulated throughout the day. Sometimes I follow that with a foaming face wash, sometimes not, depending on the weather &amp; if I feel unusually oily. The website states that this product is for combination/oily skin, which kept me from trying it for a long time. I wish it had occurred to me sooner that a bit of moisturizer underneath would solve that problem, because I truly never want to be without this ever again. Oh - and the damn cap! That&#039;s my only complaint, that the cap doesn&#039;t seem to close tight. Like, no satisfying snap or click when you close it. I do carry it in my bag, and have not had any issues with leaking, but I still wished the cap closed more tightly. Overall the packaging is nothing to write home about - fairly utilitarian looking blue plastic. If that keeps costs down, then I&#039;m all for it.

I&#039;ve tried many brands and formulations and this is one of my all-time favourites. 

My skin is classic combination but prone to being reactive and therefore ruddy. I love how easy this is to apply (it doesn&#039;t feel like chalky sunscreen) and how the subtle tint is, just that, subtle. Perhaps too light for anyone with a darker skin tone? 

I apply this after my other PC products and top it off it light dusting of setting powder.

It&#039;s a thin-medium consistency, tinted lotion with no discernible fragrance in a convenient squeeze tube.  The tint is sheer; this is not a high coverage tinted ss like Supergoop!&#039;s CC cream or It Cosmetics&#039; spf50  CC cream.

Pros:  
-Mineral, w/ ZnO, which I find calms my oily, acneic/rosacean/IPL damaged skin 
good everyday UV protection
-does not clog, irritate or break out my skin
-contains anti-oidants and anti-ageing ings
-works well under liquid foundation and powder - no clumping or pilling

Cons:
-Not quite as matte as I would like - I get more shine w/ this than with LRP Mineral spf50, LRP Dry-Touch gel-cream, or PC&#039;s renamed Calm Redness Relief Mineral spf30
-color is way too pink for me; looks like calamine lotion on me, but I am super yellow, and I cover this w/ foundation anyway so I don&#039;t see the pink.
-slight tendency to crease, but ZnO ss&#039;s tend to do this anyway, and this is nowhere near as bad as Cerave&#039;s ZnO ss&#039;s which crease and clump (and even peel up like Elmer&#039;s glue!) very badly.

Overall, excellent everyday ss for oily to normal people looking for a mineral ss w/ some added anti-ageing benefits.

PROS: I love the tint, it&#039;s perfect for my skin tone. It covers my redness and most of the time I don&#039;t need to wear foundation over top. When I&#039;ve prepped my skin properly (see below) my skin looks great. Next, the active ingredients in this SS are effective and I always trust PC for knowing their stuff. Finally, I love that the product did not irritate my skin and doesn&#039;t have a strong fragrance.

CONS: It is VERY drying on me. Unless I wear a heavy moisturizing cream underneath, or apply a layer of oil before applying this (I use Seabuckthorn), my skin feels incredibly uncomfortable, tight, and looks really dehydrated. Also, at US$32 plus shipping, it&#039;s quite pricey (I am in Canada) and it&#039;s inconvenient to have to wait for it in the mail.

see this was my HG sunscreen. it mattifies my oily face, it has a slight tint that brightens my face, and somehow blurs imperfections. i just really loved it.

until i read this:

http://feleciaroselabs.com/is-my-expensive-vitamin-c-serum-killing-my-skin/

and found out that in a study, they found out that palmitic acid in skin care, while it&#039;s good for making vitamin c get absorbed, is &quot;catastrophic&quot; to the skin once exposed to the sun.

and i saw &quot;Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate&quot; on the ingredients. which is another term for ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate.

I&#039;ve been using it for 4 months now.  I have fair combination skin with an occasional or hormonal breakout. I&#039;m on tretinoin so my skin is extra sensitive, and this sunscreen doesn&#039;t burn my face at all!  This stuff pretty much feels weightless on my skin and controls any oil in my t-zone throughout the day. It works excellent as a makeup primer as well and helps my makeup last all day, unlike other sunscreens that I&#039;ve used. It also has a slight tint that looks nice on my skin and slightly blurs minor imperfections.  I&#039;m really wanting to try Paula&#039;s spf 50 fluid for the hot and humid summers here. I really love all Paula&#039;s Choice products I&#039;ve ever used and her products along with skincare advice, and beautypedia, have really changed my skin in the best way possible.

During the day time I use Cerave foaming facewash, Paula&#039; Choice Hydralight toner, Clinique dramatically different moisturizing GEL mixed with 2-3 drops of Paula&#039;s Choice Vitamin C serum, this Paula&#039;s Choice Resist spf 30, let it dry 5 minutes then foundation and the rest of my makeup routine and my skin hasn&#039;t been better!!!  At night I like to actually use Paula&#039;s Choice for Men night cream with Retinol (good stuff!) or Clinique Moisture surge after my cleansing routing and applying Paula&#039;s Choice Skin Perfecting liquid with 2%Bha...the nights I&#039;m not using my tretinoin. On those nights I wait 20min after applying tretinoin then use Clinique moisture surge on top. Love that stuff!

I&#039;m new to this site and hope I can find another great sunscreen and line of products to try!

i use pc&#039;s bha gel at night, so i have to use a sunscreen throughout the day.

this is the only one that i&#039;ll use on my face. i like the tint, i have some redness in my skin - but after applying this, i can skip foundation. i have been using this for over two years now. never caused any problems. it is rather drying, which works for me - i don&#039;t get shiny or oily by the end of the day or after a strenous bike ride in hot weather.

it has a little bit of a smell, not unpleasant but distinct. this goes away after a few moments. 

one tube lasts me about 9 months (but i only apply on days i have to leave the house and be outside a lot.)",2016-04-14T12:03:00.000Z,2882965,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,anra,3,Normal,Fair-Medium,Not Sure,Brunette,Wavy,Fine,Blue,30-35,8

A background on my skin: I had chemotherapy at the age of 24 (I am 26 now) which destroyed my skin. I now have extremely sensitive, red, acne prone skin that reacts to anything and everything.  Hence why I try to use mineral sunscreens over chemical and all products I use are for the most sensitive of skin. On top of this, I have combination skin (yay)

The tint is perfect and is just enough to neutralise my redness. It has physical sunscreen which is perfect for my sensitive skin and its not heavy or oily. I don&#039;t feel like Im wearing sunscreen at all. It does smell a bit like paint but the smell disappears quite quickly. I don&#039;t breakout, I don&#039;t get itchy and it doesn&#039;t sit on top of my skin but rather blends in perfectly.

This is the only sunscreen I can use that does not burn the hell out of my skin (due to chemical sunscreen) or turn me white as a ghost (due to physical sunscreen) or make my skin feel sticky/oily.

I have severely dry skin with plenty of eczema, yet I also get an oily t-zone, especially in warm weather. It is very hard to find products to satisfy my entire face. I used to use Clinique City Block Sheer with great success, but they must have changed the formula because now it triggers my eczema.

The Resist Super-light is a mineral sunscreen/tinted moisturizer that dries down matte but does not dry out my skin in any way. I do use a good moisturizer underneath, as my skin is VERY dry. It is slightly tinted so no white cast. It does even out the skin tone ever so slightly, as any tinted moisturizer would do. It would be great if they came out with different shades, but honestly it is so sheer you can&#039;t even notice that it leans pink (the tint is there to neutralize the white cast). It is amazing for eczema prone skin, or any skin! I can use this in the summer or Canadian winter. Feels like nothing on the face. Loaded with antioxidants. Love love love!!!

Usually I shop around trying to find something better - ever hopeful.  I&#039;m giving this 5 lippies because I&#039;m repurchasing.

It just seems to do exactly what it&#039;s supposed to do for me.  Even though it&#039;s only very lightly tinted (hardly at all really), it instantly makes my skin look a little better.  On the weekends, I can go with this project with no other face makeup.  For work I wear either liquid foundation over it, or powder, and it plays well with both.  (With the exception of my Armani foundation which doesn&#039;t go well over anything else, so I don&#039;t blame this Resist sunscreen for that problem).

It&#039;s not shiny, but also not too matte - i.e., it doesn&#039;t look dry and powdery.  And it doesn&#039;t cause me to break out.

The only downside is the price, which seems a little high for the size of the tube.  But still, I throw away so much product that doesn&#039;t work, paying this price for something I will actually use makes it worthwhile.

156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,8,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,4,"My skin is normal leaning dry, and my climate is cold. However, the summer months here are quite hot and it can be very humid sometimes. I bought this to use as a summer moisturizer. I had previously used the Hydralight day cream and loved it, but wanted to try this new RESIST product that has a tint. 

I love this lotion because of the slight gel-cream texture and the mattifying effect it has on the face, while still making my skin very soft. It does not break me out or irritate me in any way, and because it features a natural sunscreen, I can apply it around the eye area with no stinging. 

A note on the tint in this product- it is not a &quot;tinted moisturizer&quot; in the sense of how we think of TMs these days (i.e. a light makeup/foundation product with some skin care benefits). This product is a moisturizer first and foremost and cannot be considered makeup. The tint is very sheer and is meant only to eliminate the white cast of the zinc oxide sunscreen. For this, the tint works very well, and it is so subtle I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if darker-skinned people could also wear this product. However, the tint does little to nothing to even out skin tone or hide discolourations. I did take this lotion on a trip to Greece and wore it instead of foundation most days, simply because I wanted to cut down on the amount of products I took with me. However, I still needed concealer for my under eye area. My skin is very clear, but if I had been broken out I wouldn&#039;t have gotten away with just wearing this lotion instead of foundation.

This is one of the pricier creams in Paula&#039;s line. While it is clearly a very good moisturizer, I am not sure if I like it that much more than the much cheaper Hydralight lotion. Hydralight has no tint but I don&#039;t think it leaves a white cast on my face either, perhaps because I am so fair. Overall I think I prefer the texture of the RESIST lotion to Hydralight, and based on the ingredients RESIST probably has better anti-aging properties, but I&#039;m not sure it justifies the price difference. 

I have yet to see if this lotion is moisturizing enough for my winter skin. I did buy another tube so I will try it out and update.

I would recommend this lotion if your skin liked the Hydralight lotion, or if you needed something like Hydralight and found it came up short. RESIST Super-Light is marketed toward oily skin, but slightly dry-skinned folks like me can also benefit if the climate is right.  

UPDATE: This lotion is definitely not suitable for my winter skin. I found my face getting quite dry as the mercury dropped, so I switched over to the Hydralight and that seems to have fixed the problem. Hydralight is actually quite nourishing for an &quot;oily skin&quot; lotion; RESIST Super-Light is definitely lighter and not as moisturizing. So I still definitely recommend Super-Light if Hydralight was too heavy for you or broke you out. Personally I&#039;d still consider it for summer.

1. you have very oily skin and need a mattifying sunscreen.
2. You have combo/oily and live in very hot weather that your face becomes an oil mess.
3. You dont mind any smell or tint in a product as this product has a slight tint with whitish residues and has a slight unpleasant smell in my opinion.

As a result, I returned this product, because I live in a cold weather place that my combo skin became dry now. Second, its not moisturizing what so ever. Third, I hate the smell. Fourth, if I layer it with other moisturizeres, it breaks me out.

156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,12,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,5,"I love this sunscreen, and tbh it&#039;s the only one that really keeps me vigilant about sun protection. I paid $32 for a 2oz tube, which is fairly pricey, but I&#039;m about 1/3 done with it and have been using it allll summer. It provides an SPF of 30 from 13% zinc oxide and contains antioxidants and reservatrol for extra goodness. Packaging is utilitarian as hell, but I don&#039;t care one whit.

The reasons I put forth the effort to use it: 

- The zinc oxide provides non-icky physical sun protection (chemical sunscreens weird me out) while being excellent for my skin overall, as zinc helps with acne and other unsavory skin thingies.
- The sheer tint negates that white cast from the zinc, and while it is VERY sheer it somehow does a great job of blurring imperfections and dimishing redness. I wear this under a base most days but it would not be inconceivable for me to wear it alone.
- It&#039;s my favorite primer, hands down: mattifies, blurs, smooths, and extends the life of my makeup better than all regular primers I&#039;ve tried. Feels like a primer on skin too, no tackiness, greasiness, or heaviness.
- It has never ever broken me out or anything similar, it does contain &#039;cones which my skin can be sensitive to but I&#039;ve had no issues. (This is probably why it feels like a primer, haha.)
- Has never irritated the delicate eye area, I use it directly on my lids with no problems whatsoever, including getting on my contacts, which is something I can&#039;t say for like, anything else I use.

In short, meld keeping my skin healthy with my insufferable desire for short-term gratification and vanity and I will apply it daily!

I honestly have nothing bad to say about it. I imagine if you have very dry skin this might not be the best option for you. 10/10 will repurchase.

156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,9,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,5,"Love, love LOVE this lightly tinted sunscreen, and that&#039;s just what it is.  It&#039;s 13% zinc oxide--the reason at 44, my skin has very few mild wrinkles (using it daily 20+ years)--and tinted, which overrides the frequent whitish cast of zinc.  It&#039;s chock-full of antioxidants &amp; soothing extracts.  My dry skin adores it, and the tinting is so slight that it&#039;s imperceptible.

Bear in mind a few things:

1.  Zinc oxide:  yes, your skin will likely feel like it can&#039;t &quot;breathe,&quot; at least until you get used to it.  This is because zinc is a PHYSICAL blocker of UVA/UVB rays but also pollutants, and it has skin-healing properties (which is why you see it in high doses in diaper cream &amp; other products used, for example, in the elderly &amp; those with paralysis/wheelchair-bound who are not ambulatory &amp; suffer skin breakdown from pressure points).  It is the strongest sunscreen you can get.  Avobenzone, a chemical sunscreen, breaks down within two hours of UV exposure so you have to reapply it.  I use it often on my arms &amp; legs, but I keep a spray (Australian Gold--it has no drying alcohol like all the others) on hand to reapply.

2.  Oily skin:  this simply may not work since zinc does have a greasiness to it, BUT, if you really want to be aggressive on maintaining your skin, that&#039;s the trade off.  (See below about Paula&#039;s compact powder).  My skin will get &quot;glowy&quot; by the end of the day, or midway through during our uber hot &amp; humid summers down here, but I&#039;m not bothered by it since I can blot most with a tissue &amp; I&#039;d rather look younger than like worn leather shoe.  

3.  Don&#039;t expect coverage.  It&#039;s very light at best &amp; would even out only very mild discolorations on fair-to-medium skin.  It is NOT a foundation &amp; does not claim to be:  it is a lightly tinted SUNSCREEN.  Heavy duty too.

I gave up liquid foundation years ago since it always looked cakey &amp; was like a neon sign to the lines I have, switching to a dusting of powder instead (Paula&#039;s powder foundation is fabulous AND offers zinc &amp; titanium dioxide protection, so you get an extra layer).  

It&#039;s definitely worth trying if you can manage through wearing a high level of zinc oxide, and will afford your skin the best products available.",2015-08-20T14:18:00.000Z,2819211,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,RachelXVI,9,Very Dry,Fair-Medium,Neutral,Blond,Wavy,Fine,Blue,44-55,106

My only gripe is the price. It&#039;s expensive for the small amount you get.

I am extremely picky when it comes to facial sunscreens, and this one is just about perfect: very light wearing, matte, invisible, no animal testing. It feels like nothing once it&#039;s on and doesn&#039;t rub off or transfer. Huge bonuses for being also a physical block and having sample sizes available.

As a makeup primer, it also does its job very well. It&#039;s very mattifying, and the slight tint does make the surface of my skin look more even. It does go on pinkish but the colour disappears into my pale yellow toned skin. I put concealer and a bit of powder on top, but without the additional makeup I wouldn&#039;t need any powder at all.

The light tint does not offer coverage.

This is an exceptional physical sunscreen - for all skin types. There is no shine or white cast, it&#039;s not drying, and it&#039;s non irritating and hasn&#039;t caused any breakouts. Oh, and when I use this, the redness and discolouration on my face is less evident (even when I remove it I mean). 

This does have a tint, but not enough to provide any real colour. If anything, it functions like an extremely lightweight tinted moisturiser. I like to wear it with alone or under makeup, as it makes no difference to the finish or longevity of my makeup. 

This does have an odd smell, kind of like liquorice... but not sweet. I can&#039;t say I&#039;m fond of it, but it doesn&#039;t hinder the quality of the product, and the scent dissipates once I&#039;ve finished applying it.

I really can&#039;t say enough good things about this. I was previously using Shiseido city block spf30, which was great, but it still left a slight sheen and the alcohol content worried me.

It was another Paula&#039;s Choice product that destroyed my skin--Resist Barrier Repair containing Retinol.  The Resist Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 is a wonderful product for normal to oily skin or combination skin.  I use it on my nose, which is my only oily part. It melts right in and improves the look of the skin on my nose.  It looks matte and smooth.  I will repurchase it and use it only on my nose from now on.  The reason I didn&#039;t give it 5 lippies is because it isn&#039;t moisturizing enough for the rest of my face, so I have to purchase two different daytime moisturizers.

I thought this would be suitable for a daily sunscreen with light moisture for my combo skin in the spring and summer, but this stuff was a terrible disaster for my skin! I usually have trouble-free skin, but when I switched to Paula&#039;s Choice my skin got destroyed. Bumps, flaking like crazy, and small red spots. I almost wondered if I had developed rosacea.

Physical sunscreens suck out the moisture from my skin, and in this case there is nothing to counteract the drying effect. I couldn&#039;t wait to wash it down in the evening, it was so drying, although I used it with the Skin Recovery moisturizer without SPF. 
The texture is quite runny, but it solidifies quickly after the application, forming a kind of mask that has to be bombed down with a good make-up remover at the end of the day. It has a slight tint, which is a nice color, unnoticeable, if you use a small amount, but when I applied it liberally, I could see the border of the product by my ears and my neck, because it was too dark. It is extremely mattifying, which must be a huge plus for people with very oily skin, but it looked unnatural on me. 
To sum it up, I think it&#039;s a good product, but only for people with oily skin. If you have dry skin, try the Cellular Defense from the Resist line, if your skin is normal or combination, I recommend Clinique&#039;s City Block SPF 25.

It also does not work well with makeup over it. I am very sorry I bought a back-up tube of this.


I&#039;ve come around on this sunscreen. I used it all summer when my skin was combination and it was great. The tint is a little off-putting because it is pink but once it&#039;s rubbed in it disappears. And I had to get used to the texture which felt very occlusive due to the high level of zinc--very mask-like--but once I did I liked it because it didn&#039;t irritate my rosacea and helped to dry some breakouts. The tint just blurs my skin but I still need concealer.

It is pretty expensive but all of PC&#039;s prices have gone up. But I have repurchased. I like it better than the sheer matte TM which runs too yellow and oxidizes orange on me. My other favorite is the Hydralight SPF which also works well with my finicky skin. Someone mentioned mixing the hydralight with the Resist.

You blend it out like a normal lotion and after about a minute it&#039;s as weightless as powder. I apply a LOT of this and it is never heavy or patchy. There&#039;s no white cast like other mineral sunscreens because of the slight tint. The tint is a little light for me but it matches to my skin tone after a few minutes.

156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,11,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,5,"Pros - The tint isn&#039;t obtrusive. It isn&#039;t quite on the level of a BB cream. Instead, it is meant to prevent the &quot;white cast&quot; that otherwise comes with mineral sunscreens - and I actually love the very sheer tint. Very gentle, even around the eyes. Leaves a dewy, semi-matte finish.

Cons - Small amount for the price, considering that you must use liberally to get proper sun protection. Not moisturizing enough for dry skin without using a separate moisturizer. Unfortunately, there is no comparable PC product for dry skin. 

Due to the size/price ratio and the fact that I must use a separate moisturizer, I&#039;m currently looking for a different product. If PC elected to make this in a larger size, for a better price, and in a formula suitable for dry to very dry skin, it would be my HG.

I wanted something with a high-enough SPF for Florida and lucky for me I don&#039;t have to pay a whole bunch of attention to the ingredients.  Just happy she does not test on animals and that the refund policy is very good.
Anyway, 30 SPF should be enough for daily use, meaning environmental exposure, walking to car, casual outdoor time.  Any more exposure than that I always go to a &quot;real&quot; sunscreen.
The packaging is fab, its a narrow tip tube that dispenses moderately so you don&#039;t get a big &quot;SPLOOSH&quot; out.  The color to me is a cream-ish/white; other reviewers say this shows up on your skin but I don&#039;t notice it. I hope I&#039;m using enough!  Feel is smooth but not silky/silicone.
It leaves my skin slightly matte, which I like.  Then I use Paula&#039;s tinted sunscreen..I know, I know, that sounds like overkill but I don&#039;t want alot of color, and I do so like her products.

I wish it had higher UVA protection like French or Asian sunscreens (but I blame the FDA for that, not Paula&#039;s Choice). HOWEVER, everything else about this sunscreen is perfect.

First, there is no greasiness at all. It reminds me a lot of those &quot;liquid-to-powder&quot; foundations. It feels like it dries down immediately, similarly to Asian sunscreens except Paula somehow manages to do it without the alcohol. Amazing.

Second, it is slightly tinted so I actually stopped wearing tinted moisturizer. I wear the proper amount (1/4 tsp) and it does NOT look cakey at all, unlike tinted moisturizers with SPF if I try to wear the same amount. There&#039;s no white cast at all. However, I am NC20. I can see the tint being a problem for darker skintones.

Also, no fragrance! Yay!

Except.....it&#039;s just too pink. And a touch light...like the tint is really meant for people with super fair complexions. It&#039;s not universal at all. It&#039;s for pale, cool toned fair skinned folks. 

If I am going to have to add the extra step of a product on top to correct color, I don&#039;t see why I need to start with a $29 per small tube of sunscreen. Blue lizard face is super whitening,mouth less drying and cheaper. MD solar sciences bb cream is a bit more expensive, but the tint is dead on.

It&#039;s my go-to sunscreen. I have tried other face SPFs from higher-price boutique brands but I keep returning to this particular product because:

1) price is reasonable
2) I trust Paula with regards to effective overall UVA/UVB sun protection 
3) the product is not tested on animals.

I literally have ordered five at a time when this product goes on sale. It&#039;s fabulous for oily skin, as it mattifies slightly but certainly doesn&#039;t add any oiliness. It&#039;s gorgeous under foundation or with no foundation at all.

I highly recommend. One of the best Paula&#039;s Choice products there is, in my opinion.",2015-01-06T10:15:00.000Z,2743358,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,iloveurbandecay,5,Normal,Fair,Neutral,Brunette,Straight,Medium,Blue,36-43,99

No white face upon application! It has a nice matte effect, but is not very moisturizing (maybe it is enough in summer, though).  I do need some kind of cream underneath, especially during winter. I even can go without foundation since this has a bit of a neutral colour. Just some concealer here and there and I am good to go! Good job Paula Begoun!

It really feels light but slightly moisturising, have worn this in cold weather without becoming dry and flaky. The slight tint helps and the lotion feels gorgeous on the skin. 
It&#039;s like a light moisturising version of my adored Clinique&#039;s City block, that I use in the summer.

However, it made me break out in cystic acne (which I haven&#039;t had in years). I also found the tint was a little too light for my skin tone. So, I ended up looking a little chalky/cakey after I put my regular powder over top. I&#039;m a huge lover of PC face washes and sunscreens but this one just didn&#039;t fit the bill for me!",2014-12-17T13:59:00.000Z,2736305,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,jackietaylor135,3,Acne-prone,Olive,Unknown,Blond,Unknown,Unknown,Green,30-35,1
156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,1,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,5,"This is a terrific moisturizer. I was a little skeptical at first because I&#039;m very devoted to my drugstore choices, Neutrogena and Cerave, but I had a sample of this and the texture blew me away. It&#039;s a very light lotion and it&#039;s faintly tinted- not enough to give me any significant color as a NW20, light-medium complexion. I think those who are lighter than me might notice more of a difference with the tint. At any rate, the lotion is tinted slightly I think to cover up the white-ish cast that lotions with sun protection tend to have. This is very effective. The texture is light and fluffy and the squeeze container (pointed down) is a perfect second to having an air-pump. On me, the lotion absorbs very fast and leaves a wonderful silky (but not silicone-y) feel to my skin. It feels hydrated and clean. Perfect for all the seasons but maybe in the most humid or coldest weather I might need to change up for something lighter or heavier respectively. A great buy- $29 for 2 oz which should last me a good three months with 1x/daily use.

More importantly, I can wear this on my neck and my chest with out it burning and itching like crazy. Even the Blue Lizard &quot;chemical free&quot; stuff caused an allergic reaction on my neck and chest when I wore it. When I first received the sample of this, the pink tint turned me off. I have a yellow, tan tone on my Asian skin and I didn&#039;t think it work, but once it settled, I didn&#039;t even need to wear any foundation. All I needed was some concealer under my eyes and a dab of blush or bronzer. I also jog with this stuff on. Paula&#039;s staff said it&#039;s somewhat waterproof and their right. I jog 3 to 4 miles in LA heat  and still see the film on my face when I&#039;m done. I love this stuff.

156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,2,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,3,"OK basically this is a very nice sunscreen with one major drawback (apart from price).It has 13% zinc oxide as active ingredient, which is unusual but nice for those of us who are not fans of titanium dioxide or chemical agents. I would prefer a higher SPF, but possibly this is a question of cosmetic elegance of the end product because zinc oxide in high concentrations is quite thick and claggy. So, OK for an everyday s/s but not to go out in the sun (I have melasma). 

It is indeed very light in texture and easy to apply. There is no discernible shine. The texture is not moisturising though, so for my combination skin I still need to apply a light moisturizer underneath. 

Now the downside: the tint is anything but natural - it&#039;s actually a greyish pink! Seriously, on my pale yellow toned skin it looks just awful. It is very sheer, true - but it still does have a subtle effect. Please Paula, why can&#039;t you create a pale yellow option for those of us who have yellow-toned skin (or need a bit of subtle colour correcting, i.e. the pink face-yellow neck syndrome...) !! Do that and I swear, I&#039;ll buy this by the cartload. As it is, alas, I won&#039;t.

I used to use Skinceuticals physical fusion, but I think this PC product is so much better! It is nearly perfect: 13% zinc oxide, antioxidants, controls oil yet not drying (if I wear moisturizer underneath), and no white cast. My complexion is n15 and the tint is fine for me and I like how it evens out my skin tone a bit. I still use foundation, though. My only criticisms: it claims to moisturize but found it drying when used on its own, the finish can feel a little tacky, and it&#039;s not officially water resistant. However, according to a company rep the product is water resistant but was not put through tests to earn the water resistant label.  If they ever discontinue this, I will be so upset because nothing else compares!

156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,0,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,5,"I use this as my foundation (tinted moisturizer) and totally love it.  It gives me just the right amount of sheer coverage to even out my skin tone without masking my natural skin texture or marks, etc.  I use just one layer in the morning, but it is buildable to a more medium coverage.  I initially used this *as* sunscreen, but after some research I realized I should just purchase a separate sunscreen and use this on top (the pea-size amount I use daily isn&#039;t enough of the product to get the advertised SPF).  I do like having the extra bit of protection throughout the day, though.  My favorite application method is to dot it across my face, then use a buffing brush to stipple it on, and finally buff it in gently.  

Pros: 
* natural finish
* applies evenly; blends well
* buildable
* doesn&#039;t settle into lines/creases
* great price
* long-lasting
* great for 5 minute make-up days (just this, blush, and some mascara, perfect!)

Cons: 
* very light coverage
* not enough SPF",2014-11-04T00:14:00.000Z,2722652,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,kbam17,2,Combination,Fair,Warm,Blond,Straight,Medium,Hazel,25-29,72
156,355,Paula's Choice,22,Sunscreen,1,164554,RESIST Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 30 - Normal/Oily/Combination Skin,5,"To answer &quot;...would you buy this product again?&quot;...Yes, I have purchased twice as back ups.  I&#039;m not sure how this will do once real winter dryness kicks in.  I have dry skin normally and have been able to use this during that late summer/early fall with a moisturizer underneath.  I am sensitive to chemical sunscreen, but the physical sunscreens for dry skin are just so heavy.  If I need to switch to a dry skin formulation this winter I will, and then gladly come back to this for spring, summer, and fall.  This works very well as sunscreen and primer.  It wears well under a variety of foundations I have tried it with.  It blends in easily and doesn&#039;t leave a white cast or feel heavy.  It is fragrance free, another area of sensitivity for me.  I really enjoy it.

UPDATE (12/16/2014):  my skin started to feel dry and tight, and foundation looked horrid as we entered into fall/winter weather.  I switched to a more rich formula and hated it!  I couldn&#039;t wait to wash my face.  Paula&#039;s Choice released Resist Intensive Relief Cream and the Resist Oil Booster which I started to use.  (I love these BTW.). Adding a more moisturizing base has allowed me to run back to this!  It wears well, and is fabulous under foundation.  I will use this year round!  

Oh yes, it is effective sunscreen.  I have attended several fall outdoor sporting events and my face hasn&#039;t burned or darkened.",2014-11-01T16:18:00.000Z,2721875,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3560186.JPG,dustyjil,1,Dry,Fair-Medium,Cool,Blond,Straight,Fine,Green,44-55,48
