255,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,5,3123,Super City Block SPF 25,4,"Overall I think the product is great. Basically like a tinted moisturiser but with high SPF (I use 40).

I have been using it for a little while now and after the recent bank holiday heatwave we had in the UV didn&#039;t experience any sunburn after sitting outside for 3 days straight reading my book! So it definitely works to protect against the sun - haven&#039;t worn it abroad though so not sure about that.

I would say I am spot prone but haven&#039;t experienced any problems with the product. I normally have oily skin but have started to experience dry and quite sore skin (after washing when moisturising). Not sure if it is the product but have ordered a night time oil which should help my skin out.

Would definitely buy again.. anything is worth it to prevent aging!",2019-04-26T16:40:00.000Z,3051983,thumb/h/145/6_1_9_0_1281666.JPG,lizziebizzie,5,Combination,Fair,Unknown,Blond,Unknown,Unknown,Blue,19-24,1
255,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,2,3123,Super City Block SPF 25,4,"I want to love this because it can be used around the eye area (Clinique says so). it’s a nice formula that spreads well, isn’t heavy feeling on the skin and isn’t whitening. It even wears well under makeup. No chemical sunscreen smell, no smell whatsoever for thst matter. But I can’t use it in the winter months when this kind of product is a good choice for me despite using a heavy moisturizer. I believe Clinique’s claim of it absorbing excess oil because I’ve tried this over a generous application of argan oil, which usually counteracts the drying effects of mineral sunscreens, and my skin still feels super dry within an hour of application. I have a preferred summer sunscreen (australian gold botanical spf50 tinted face lotion) that wears better than this because it withstands a bit of sweating and I can wear it swimming. This isn’t water resistant and Clinique’s claim of it wicking perspiration isn’t true, it sweats right off and I can’t just blot it because it all comes off on my tissue and if I have any makeup on top it turns into a cakey mess.
I honestly can’t devalue it because Clinique does say up front it absorbs oil, but I take off a lippie because Clinique says it can handle sweating and I say it can’t. ",2018-12-22T01:45:00.000Z,3039144,thumb/h/145/6_1_9_0_1281666.JPG,notjustgingerly,2,Dry,Fair,Cool,Blond,Wavy,Fine,Blue,44-55,296

255,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,1,3123,Super City Block SPF 25,4,"I started using this a few years ago after I read fabulous reviews on another website. (not sure if I am allowed to name it).

This is my go-to sunscreen. I wear it every single day. The coverage is good enough that I can just use that and put some concealer under my eyes if I don&#039;t feel like wearing foundation.

It is expensive though - $36 in Australia. I&#039;ve been looking around for another tinted moisturiser that has a good sunscreen that is a bit cheaper, but I&#039;m yet to find one. We don&#039;t have a great range in Australia.",2016-09-29T01:43:00.000Z,2920466,thumb/h/145/6_1_9_0_1281666.JPG,Adoratea,1,Combination,Fair,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Blue,44-55,1
255,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,3,3123,Super City Block SPF 25,2,"With my very pale, very sensitite, rosacea-prone skin I&#039;m always looking out for good sunscreens that don&#039;t irritate, but still give good protection. I&#039;m fed up with the white cast that so many leave, even though they say they don&#039;t! 

This product had some very good reviews so I decided to try it out. It went on easily and blended very nicely, and I liked the effect of the slight tint on my skin. In fact, apart from the red patches I get on my cheeks and nose, I could use this as a foundation. I thought this was great! All I needed to add was a bit of concealer on those red bits, and then I wouldn&#039;t need any other foundation at all.

Unfortunately, after an hour or so my skin began to tingle. This, for me, is always a sign that my rosacea is being aggravated. I tried to convince myself I was imagining it, because I liked the look of it so much! But it didn&#039;t go away.

The tingling became a stinging, and after another hour I had to take off all the product, which is a real hassle to do in the morning when I&#039;m otherwise finished and ready to go. And when I took it off, the stinging stopped. So I know it was this product which had caused it.

It&#039;s a great pity. I think if your skin is not too sensitive and you are on the pale side, this is a very good daily product to use when the sun is not too strong - for us in England, that is the period from September through to April, when you don&#039;t really need a higher spf. But for those of us with very, very sensitive skin and rosacea, it doesn&#039;t fit our needs.

255,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,2,3123,Super City Block SPF 25,3,"Pros:
- Has a relatively high spf
-Can function as a primer 
-Acts as another light layer of foundation to hide blemishes
-Uses natural sunscreen ingredients
-No alcohol
-Good looking packaging

Cons:
-Had to change my whole skin regime based on this product (just so I could wear this again!) as this made me look tired, dull skin and patchy after a few hours.  
-It&#039;s tinted and the colour results in me looking far too pale.
-Greasy looking and feeling, when wearing on top of moisturiser but if not, then it:
-Clings to dry patches and shows up more obvious if wearing this on its own.
-Expensive at £18

I&#039;ve essentially been using this before my BB cushion as a primer but I am put off by using any greasy feeling products atm.  So not very often, do I find myself reaching out for this product.  It is also too shiny and greasy looking to be wearing on its own.  There are far more better spf primers or tinted spf moisturisers out there if that&#039;s what you are after.    

I purchased this because I kinda like how it is not trying to sell itself as a tinted moisturiser and I liked the idea of something simple to subtlety even out my skin tone (to subconsciously think I&#039;m not wearing make-up.  Daft I know!)

This can be used as a tinted foundation as it has a colour to it. Its a smooth texture, claims it&#039;s not greasy and a little goes a long way.

I have combination skin and sensitive skin &amp; eyes. This product irritates my eyes even though I do not put it under my eye. My eyes run, go puffy and blotchy and eventually I get that awful red eye liner look. Also I am not sure if it blocks pores or not but after a while I break out in tiny spots which itch. My skin also looks shiny after a few hours and makes my foundation look awful then, even on my cheeks which are dewy, dull and not oily I get the odd spot there, which I never normally do. This product isn&#039;t for me at all. I need more of a matt sunscreen so will keep searching for it.

255,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,4,3123,Super City Block SPF 25,4,"I use the European version, which has only one active ingredient: titanium dioxide (no zinc oxide), otherwise I think it&#039;s basically the same. It&#039;s slightly tinted, but it has very sheer coverage. It&#039;s not visible at all, but it helps to avoid the white cast these types of products usually have. It&#039;s best for normal skin, but if your skin is drier you can use a moisturizer under it. I haven&#039;t experienced any irritation, and I&#039;m satisfied with the protection this product gives.
Why not 5 lippies? I find titanium dioxide in any product uncomfortable to wear. During the day it sucks the moisture out of my skin and especially if the sun is very strong it stings. My skin reacts much better to chemical sunscreens, and Estee Lauders&#039;s DayWear SPF 50 is my HG. So, it&#039;s a great titanium dioxide product, if that&#039;s what you&#039;re looking for, but if your skin prefers other sunscreen ingredients, you can easily find something you&#039;ll like better somewhere else.

It didn&#039;t give me pimples or cysts but it made my pores stand out and actually some grains of sebum were rolling out from the first time I put this SS on my skin! So that is gross honestly. 
It is drying even for my oily nose BUT it makes it oily...uhh? 
And it gives a sheen but it is not a big problem.
 It is hard to spread even on moisturised skin and I need to use a lot and for the price is not worth it.

I&#039;m happy to say that, so far, City Block Sheer has proved to be the best facial sunscreen I&#039;ve used yet. It comes in a neat little tube that you could easily take out with you should you need to reapply, and while it isn&#039;t particularly generous in size a little seems to go a fairly long way. Perhaps my favourite thing about this sunscreen is its tint; it comes out in a fleshy tone rather than white and goes onto the skin nice and even. Though I&#039;m fair skinned, the tint blends in straight away and looks perfectly natural, if anything it slightly evens out my complexion and masks some of the redness - an added bonus! It&#039;s also far less greasy than other mineral sunscreens I&#039;ve tried - once it&#039;s been applied I&#039;m not really aware of it and my face doesn&#039;t get much oilier than it normally would throughout the day. It won&#039;t mattify your oily skin, but it does give a little bit of moisture without worsening oiliness. Touch wood, I haven&#039;t had noticeable more breakouts than before, so it doesn&#039;t seem to clog my pores either.
My one problem so far is that it can go on a bit flaky in places, particularly around the nose. It&#039;s not too noticeable unless looking closely, but it can exacerbate enlarged pores sometimes. Perhaps if this product was a little bit more moisturising it would improve the texture somewhat, but it&#039;s a small compromise. 

Overall, it&#039;s a keeper for now. I wish there were more products like this out there - highly sensitive yet oily skin doesn&#039;t really get much support, certainly not in UK stores. It makes a nice change to find something that&#039;s truly suitable for my skin!",2013-08-06T10:59:00.000Z,2534536,thumb/h/145/6_1_9_0_1281666.JPG,geeemm,2,Sensitive,Fair,Not Sure,Blond,Straight,Fine,Hazel,19-24,21

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I&#039;ve used Clinique&#039;s City Block for about 10 years. When I was first using it, they were making this in SPF 15! After so long, and some dalliances with other sunscreens, this is still the best choice for me. My combination, oily skin gets clogged and breaks out easily and this one has the least amount of interference with that. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#039;t burn my skin the way that chemical and other sunscreens will (zinc oxide can be horrid!). I love the light tint that it has, which allows me to skip tinted moisturizers or foundations all together. I can&#039;t count the number of tubes I&#039;ve used, but I know that I&#039;ll be buying countless more.

255,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,1,3123,Super City Block SPF 25,5,"This SPF face cream is by far the best I&#039;ve ever tried. I have extremely oily skin and have had the worst luck finding a face cream with a high enough SPF to actually ward off the sun&#039;s rays (SPF 15 is laughable nowadays). This particular SPF face cream is a non-chemical sunscreen so it literally sits on top of your skin BUT it blends nicely and it never feels as if I&#039;m wearing a heavy sunscreen mask. There&#039;s a light tint to cover the whiteness of the SPF and I find that it&#039;s enough colour to act as a light foundation for my pale, freckled skin (I don&#039;t like wearing a lot of products on my face). If I apply it and nothing else, my skin is definitely shiny but I always wear a powder on top to mattify and smooth my face. It&#039;s oil-free so it never melts or cakes on my face, even during extremely humid summers. It&#039;s also a great moisturiser for my oily skin - the Clinique people will tell you it&#039;s not a moisturiser but there are moisturising ingredients in this and if you have oily/combo skin, you definitely do not need to wear a regular moisturiser underneath. I wear this everyday and it&#039;s easy to remove at night b/c it does not get absorbed into your skin. I would highly recommend this product for those who want great everyday SPF protection plus tint for some coverage.

255,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,8,3123,Super City Block SPF 25,2,"In my search for &quot;the holy mineral sunscreen&quot; I&#039;m always looking for one that a/doesn&#039;t irritate my sensitive skin, b/doesn&#039;t make me look like a ghost and C/isn&#039;t sticky and greasy. Because of the good rates on beautypedia I decided to give this one a try.So what do I think about it? 

First of all there&#039;s the color...  A slightly tinted sunscreen:  great idea, the only problem is that they only offer like 1 shade and I can imagine that this is the reason why a lot of people don&#039;t like....Like me... I&#039;m a NC20 and I find this sunscreen slightly to dark for me. I do like that it evens out my skin tone, but it&#039;s just to yellow/orangy for me. I have also noiticed that it tends to oxidize during the day :(

Second: this is not the ideal sunscreen for you if you have oily skin. I can use this when it&#039;s getting colder and my skin is getting slightly drier, but in summertime my skin is way to oily for this one. Not very attractive. Tried to put some powder on top of it, but omg, that was...not...a...good...idea. So i also must conclude that:

This is also not great as a primer/makeup base for when u like to use powder foundation. It&#039;s just to sticky: you can&#039;t spread your powder foundation evenly, so it looks all blotchy . Haven&#039;t tried it with a liquid foundation though,so I can&#039;t say how it will perform with that type. But for my combination skin, I&#039;m afraid it will be a greasy mess. 

Last but not least: did it irritate my skin? Well, it didn&#039;t itch of sting, or aggravate my rosacea, so that was good. The only thing i&#039;ve noticed is that every time use this it give&#039;s me pimples. Even after just one day. It just clogs my pores. I&#039;ve tried this a few times, with some weeks in between, just to be sure it wasn&#039;t something else.. But everytime, when I clean my face in the evening, there they are: some extra bumps :( So that&#039;s the main reason that it is a no no for me.

So to conclude: is it a bad sunscreen? Well, if you have a normal to slightly dry skin, if you aren&#039;t acne-prone and not very or extreme pale and you have a perfect skin that doesn&#039;t need a lot of coverage, but just some kind of tinted moisturizer with SPF...Then I would give this one a try.

If you&#039;re an NC15 and/or have an oily, acne prone, skin...Leave it!",2013-01-18T06:46:00.000Z,2427525,thumb/h/145/6_1_9_0_1281666.JPG,Misirlou1982,8,Sensitive,Fair-Medium,Neutral,Brown,Wavy,Fine,Brown,30-35,6

My skin is pretty much normal, but my T-Zone tends to get oilier than my cheeks (Combination maybe?)

Only untill last year when i finish a primer, i&#039;ve decided to try this one out again as the previous primer that i used didnt have SPF in it and i had to apply sunscreen before i put that primer on..anyway so i decided to go for this product again given that it&#039;s a primer, a sunscreen and it blocks environmental harmness, and it&#039;s gentle. I can&#039;t say that i can see a dramatic effect it does to my skin but i guess sometimes you just need something that you feel safe to use a long way. It doesnt cause any breakouts, very gentle on the skin, and i havent had any bad experience with it at all, so i&#039;d say it is a safe product for daily use.

Not too expensive given the fact that it&#039;s got 40ml in a tube and it does last a fairly long time. It has a light tint in it which to be honest i would prefer it not to have, but it doesn&#039;t bother me too much as i apply foundation on top of it anyway...

&quot;The ingredient of concern is angelica archangelica root oil.

I was looking for a foundation when I started to use make up, so the Clinique  SA recommend me this product. At first I was quite skeptical as the colour has this pinkish tone that I think will look horrible in my yellowish- slightly tanned Asian skin. But when I applied it to my face, it gives a natural glow which is the main reason that I love it :)

Am not sure if it really do a good job as a sunscreen, however since now I just used make up once in a while, I realized that my skin tone now is kinda darker compared to last year when I still religiously wearing make up. But since I always treat this product as a foundation, I don&#039;t realize that it is actually a sunscreen lol.

It does make your face turn oily (for me it takes 1 hour in outdoor+daytime when I dont use primer and 2 hour when I used it with primer), so now I&#039;m looking for a HG primer which can make it last longer :)

Kinda of weird but I just feel safe if I put it on my face every morning.

It was the first sun block product I reached when I was in highschool.Yes this could be super expensive for a normal highschool girl.In China this is double priced than in US or any airport dutyfree shops. I guess I was hooked mainly because of its elements for sunblock is basic on physics but not chemistry(&gt;&lt;who knows whether it&#039;s ture,but I&#039;m just willing to believe it!)It claims to be oil free but the result always turned out to be super shiny.Anyway it does very good job in even out my skin tone,just like a foundation.I always need a tissue to absorb some of the product after I blend it,and ust a lot of loose powder afterwards.

I bought 2 of this in Denmark last year.Even though the package, the name are all the same with what i used in China.But the texture is super thick to me!And doesn&#039;t even my skin tone at all!I really really missed my chinese version while I took patience in using them up!

Since I will stay in Euro at least 4 years more,I wont buy any of this any of this product again since I really hate the ones i bought in Denmark!

I use it everyday and have never noticed the tint of the product rubbing off on my clothes. It also helps my makeup last longer. The only bad thing about it is it sometimes causes my skin to feel a tad dry, but that is easily taken care of with a bit of moisturizer.

Overall, a great sunscreen and a staple for me!

This provides a slight tint, which leaves a small amount of ghosting on my skin. However, my skintone is very pale and this does the job of making my skin look more even, which works as a light foundation without looking like I&#039;m wearing anything on my face.
This leaves my face looking slightly shiny for about 30min until it soaks in properly. This is hardly a moisturiser for my combination skin, and after wearing it a couple of days by itself, I decided to put it on after a light coating of Olay lotion. This did the trick!

255,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,0,3123,Super City Block SPF 25,4,"I like this product. Usually I don&#039;t like layering on so much stuff on my face so I opt for a moisturizer with SPF in it, but this is not bad at all. 

Me, I have oily-but-dehydrated-slightly-acne-prone skin to begin with. My acne problem is mainly on my chin area; and I&#039;m pretty much oily all over, no matter what moisturizer I use. Recently I started on the doctor-prescribed tretinoin gel, and was warned that I would definitely need sun protection. So I started the tube of this stuff I got a while back. 

It&#039;s slightly tinted, not enough to cover any major blemishes but enough to even my skin tone, toward the white side of the scale. Once I was picking at the blocked pores around my nose causing it to turn red and blotchy. I put on my usual moisturizer and then the city block, and the redness was gone! I think it covered a bit of it. 

City block is not too sheer when you put it on, nor is it oily/heavy. On my face, I feel the stickiness after I put it on so I add a layer of loose powder. Then throughout the day I&#039;m almost not oily at all (of course, this is always the slightly autumn weather instead of the summer heat). As for the sun blocking part, I don&#039;t usually go out and sit in the sun for a long time so I don&#039;t really know. But my face looks whiter after I put this on. Oh, and I use a makeup cleanser to remove it at night. ",2007-09-28T18:01:00.000Z,1084621,thumb/h/145/6_1_9_0_1281666.JPG,springsilver,0,Oily,Unknown,Unknown,Black,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,25-29,24

There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; things I like about the packaging: the DIN number, the expiry date, the tiny opening, the blue color of the SPF band on the front and the fact that the tube is travel friendly. Herein lies the rub: 1- There is no tamper-evident feature on the tube, like a seal over the opening. 2- When I don’t have the strength to squeeze any more cream out of the tube (very frustrating when I am away from home), I take a large pair of scissors, cut the tube just above the blue band in the front and scoop out the unexpected amount of product left, that is either stuck near the opening or clinging to the sides of the tube. 3- The large enough last portion of product (last time, I scooped out enough to fill a mini 15 ml/15 g Dior jar) is then transferred to a non-identifying jar where (being from now on exposed to light, air and bacteria) its lifespan is quickly reduced.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The product&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;span style=color:#6666cc&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition to titanium dioxide, the active or “medicinal” ingredient, in a concentration of 8.8 %, this cream contains a “boosted level of anti-oxidants” to help protect the skin against environmental aggressors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Which anti-oxidants? I don’t know. I can’t find an ingredients list anywhere, not on the tube, not on the box, not on the 12 x 20 cm paper insert; it’s as if Clinique Labs didn’t have enough space to write it on. (Funny thing though, the last time I bought two of these, I received a package of bonus products including a paper insert listing the ingredients in all of the &lt;em&gt;bonus&lt;/em&gt; products!) Regardless, November is coming (month when the new law requiring mandatory ingredient labelling on all cosmetic products sold in Canada comes into effect) and &lt;span style=color:#6666cc&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinique’s Super City Block SPF 25 provides high level, broad-spectrum sun protection while being gentler to the skin than chemical sunscreens due to its sensitive-skin-friendly physical block. The formula is in fact so gentle that it can even be worn on delicate eye-area skin. ONE no-nonsense product for the entire face – I like that. That’s what got me to buy it in the first place quite a few years ago and it has been my daily “face protector” since.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Also, I have no intention of switching any time soon regardless of its less than modern, problematic packaging and its insipid Clinique green color which sticks out like a sore thumb among my other products.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The way I use it&lt;/strong&gt;: I wear Super City Block SPF 25 alone under my mineral powder foundation. I wait a good ten minutes after applying and blending it carefully – go get coffee, make my lunch, put on my clothes, etc. – to let it fully absorb before I apply my foundation. In my experience, these two products work very well together because the oil-free, non-sticky formula of the cream provides all the moisture I need (I have normal/combination skin). On top of that, it just doesn’t feel or smell like sunscreen: Super City Block is very lightweight and fragrance-free. On special occasions, to make my skin appear extra smooth, I wear Lise Watier’s Base Miracle underneath it. Clinique’s website advises to apply and blend Super City Block on clean skin after all treatment products and before makeup. (Putting it on top of treatment products will prevent loss of potency or effectiveness of the active ingredient.) Clinique Labs add that this cream must be removed with an appropriate makeup solvent, one designed to remove long-wearing color. I use Neutrogena’s Fresh Foaming Cleanser which does a great job.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The look&lt;/strong&gt;: Clinique Labs claims that Super City Block SPF 25 is “invisible under makeup or alone”. The formula is sheer but the cream is not invisible on me when worn alone (I have medium skin tone and sun damage). Had I not spent so much time in the sun, unwittingly unprotected, during my childhood and teen years, I might now have the type of skin that this product would look invisible on. The cream is tinted a light beige – probably to camouflage the whitish cast of titanium dioxide – and needs to be blended. This doesn’t stop it from working very well under makeup though and it somehow makes my pores look a little less noticeable.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;: Clinique Super City Block SPF 25 Oil-Free Daily Face Protector has been granted the Skin Cancer Foundation’s International Seal of Recommendation. Yay! And I have personal proof that this product is effective: 1- I have never returned home from a motorcycle trip with sunburn on my face since I started using it; and 2- the “sun spots” that sneaked up on my face before I started using it have almost vanished and no new ones have appeared.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The cost&lt;/strong&gt;: At this moment, Clinique’s Super City Block SPF 25 costs $21.50 in Canada  for 40 ml or $16.50 in the US for 1.4 oz, a good value in my opinion for such a great face protector if you buy it during Gift with Purchase events at your local Clinique counter. I usually buy two in order to qualify for the bonus.",2006-10-02T11:55:00.000Z,879028,thumb/h/145/6_1_9_0_1281666.JPG,Marguerite,19,Normal,Fair-Medium,Unknown,Blond,Unknown,Unknown,Blue,44-55,127

It has a very light feel, is easy to remove, isn&#039;t drying (as many can be), and contains some very beneficial ingredients (vitamins C/E and anti-irritants, etc).  I like that it has a slight tint (not much, though, just enough so that it doesn&#039;t have a whitish cast), and it functions as a &#039;foundation&#039; for me except on days when my skin is very upset (I have rosacea, so it can go from great to not so great rather quickly if I don&#039;t treat it right).  Matches my pale, pale skin very nicely.  Unfortunately, I am finding that I can&#039;t really use physical sunscreens that utilize titanium dioxide in an SPF higher than 15.  I had the same trouble with mineral make-up: too much titanium dioxide.  As the day wears on, it makes my face start to itch and sting, especially in areas where I sweat.  Unfortunately, it seems that I will have to try the SPF 15 version.  I will continue to use this up on my neck/chest.  However, I would still highly recommend this to people who are looking for a purely physical sunblock that have normal to dry skin, as my face is way too testy for most people to use as a basis for comparison.",2006-07-08T18:14:00.000Z,835453,thumb/h/145/6_1_9_0_1281666.JPG,tetrakis,1,Sensitive,Fair,Unknown,Brown,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,25-29,108

It is non-irritating and leaves a soft, semi-matte sheen with a vague hint of creamy color. The caste is pretty non-offensive and might please some with it&#039;s ability to mask slight imperfections in the skin. Having said that, Clinique has come out with yet a new product: CX Protective Base SPF 40 aimed at soothing and protecting sensitive and easily irritated skin, which is the best sunscreen I have tried to date.
