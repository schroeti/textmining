321,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,3,76243,Super City Block Oil-Free Daily Face Protector Broad Spectrum SPF 40,5,"This is one of my must haves.  Has some great ingredients and really moisturising.  Makes a nice base for make up.  Packaging also very good to ensure ingredients do not connect with air.

Don’t be put off by the beige colour as it amounts to nothing (on me).

321,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,2,76243,Super City Block Oil-Free Daily Face Protector Broad Spectrum SPF 40,4,"A product I&#039;ve been using for at least 10 years, probably closer to 15. I have fair, sensitive skin with a touch of rosacea - it burns easily and I can tan pretty well, with freckles. A really superb product for coverage, SPF and non-clogging, non-greasy protection that has really protected my skin well over the years - not just sun protection, which is the most important protection, but it is called &quot;Citiblock&quot; because it works like a foundation, too - not as pretty or smooth without precise colour matching - but they have improved their formulations over the years and this provides a balance of good coverage, protection, and almost-a-foundation that I just put makeup over. No chemical smell, although I have noticed that if you rub your eyes, you will feel it sting (the chemicals are there but are &quot;low dosage&quot;). Not a 100% physical block, but a combination that is really non-irritating and provides better sun coverage than most products I&#039;ve tried. I am a fan of Clinique mascaras and this product and almost never buy other Clinique products. But this product stands out, especially for fair, sensitive skin. Have lost count of how many times I&#039;ve repurchased.",2018-08-20T14:54:00.000Z,3027033,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3524588.JPG,TorontoShopper,2,Other,Fair,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,36-43,8
321,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,1,76243,Super City Block Oil-Free Daily Face Protector Broad Spectrum SPF 40,4,"The CLINIQUE Super City Block Oil-Free Daily Face Protector Broad Spectrum SPF 40 is a nice sunscreen option for those looking for a sunscreen that is a mineral and chemical hybrid.  This sunscreen has a slight tint to it and because of that tint it really doesn&#039;t have any of the white cast that so many mineral sunscreens have.  I like that this sunscreen has an SPF level of 40, which is above the traditional SPF 30 that many sunscreens have.  This has many different antioxidants included which is good to see.  There is one citrus ingredient so if you have very sensitive skin this might be a pass, I didn&#039;t have any issues with it.  This sunscreen works well under makeup and never looks greasy or oily.  I would repurchase this again in the future.

I&#039;ve been on the lookout for a good sunscreen that doesn&#039;t cause shininess or sting my eyes that&#039;s also affordable. This fits the bill. I had been using Obagi matte sunscreen and found it inconvenient to order and expensive.  I like the way this smooths my skin and looks under my cc cream while providing sun protection.

It&#039;s non sticky, absorbs rly fast. And the tint is very subtle. Does not have a strong scent like most sunscreens. great formula that sits on top of moisturizers and beneath makeup rly well. One thing is i find that when i apply makeup straightaway after super city block, the makeup goes on nicely.

321,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,6,76243,Super City Block Oil-Free Daily Face Protector Broad Spectrum SPF 40,4,"I like but don&#039;t love this. This is a sunscreen with both physical and chemical blockers (Zinc 9.6%, Titanium dioxide, Octinoxate, Octisalate) that also has antioxidants. It feels a bit heavy on at the get-go, but the feeling does go away. It&#039;s also quite soothing because of the zinc and anti-inflamatory ingredients it has, like Licorice Root.  It has a nice faint, but sweet smell.

It has to be applied twice a day at least because it breaks down somewhat. You are supposed to do that anyway with sunscreen, but with this one you HAVE to or risk looking caky/dried out at the end of the day.

This goes on better on top of moisturized or slightly damp skin (more slip). It leaves a noticeable but not horrible glowy beige cast on my NC 42 Skintone that I easily remedy by dusting some powder over top. Lighter skintones will find this can pass as a light coverage bb cream. If you are acne-prone and on a budget, id suggest the Maybelline Super Stay Better Skin Powder. It&#039;s smoothing and has a nice light coverage; it doesn&#039;t break me out either.

As I said, it has a sheen but it&#039;s not unworkable and I say that having oily skin. It&#039;s not a greasy sunblock. On days where my skin is more normal it feels very mattifying and I HAVE to prep with moisturizer (Clinique Moisture Surge). 

Its a sunblock so I have to apply makeup on top with a sponge. Id avoid very matte foundations with it because it can make them look extra dry and crack/gather weird.

I would repurchase but its not HG.

Pro&#039;s:
+Affordable and accessible
+ Soothing (doesn&#039;t sting/anti-inflammatory)
+Safe to  use around eye area
+Mix of physical and chemical blockers
+Tinted
+Doesn&#039;t feel too heavy or greasy
+Has antioxidants
+Sanitary packaging

Cons
- Clogs my pores a little (not a lot, mainly around my nose. Happens to me with all Mineral spf)
- Only comes in a golden beige tint (My skintone is NC42), so It makes me look a bit pale.
-Doesnt play well with  my velvet matt finish  liquid makeups
-Its slightly tacky at first, though it ends up setting and feels soft.

No matter what you put on your face at night to treat/heal your skin with all your powerful treatment serums or night creams, it&#039;s all useless until you protect your face during the day.

Formulated with variety of antioxidants that treats your skin while protecting it. I also learned that it has the best ingredients - Vitamin C and E, which helps to heal and lighten scar from the previous breakout, and gradually even out my skin tone. Been using it for 2 years now, and very happy with the result.

Unfortunaly it&#039;s WAY too dark for me. It says it fits all skin tones - of course that&#039;s not true. It looks ridiculous when I put it on, since it&#039;s so much darker than my skin tone.
Price is resonable for a cream of this quality imo. I wish this could be my everyday go-to cream.

For those who have Acne prone skin and cannot find a suitable sunblock that will not cause you to break out -THIS is what you need.

I disagree with the user instructions.
1) I believe my skin felt tight if I used this alone on bare skin- it is mattifying and drying so moisturiser should be put on first.
2) I would use this over my makeup NOT under to get the maximum SPF benefit from it.
3) I would not use this as a makeup primer- there are many better primers than this

I would use this as a top layer for SPF protection and SPF 40 is good.
I like the compact tube with small hole so sensible amounts can be dispensed. 
The silver on the packaging and lid provides a badly needed style update to the ugly retro 70s packaging.

I love this product. That said, the person just below me (via dates posted) made a very good point. This product is much, much too orange for even vaguely pale people. If you are a tanned person then this may be your favorite tinted sunscreen/moisturizer. 

However, this product is also perfect for very pale people with rosacea. The yellow tones perfectly counteract the redness, and the red-all-over look I hate is replaced with a yellow-all-over which is much better. Sure, neither match your pale body but the latter is ironically much more natural looking. 

I only have a foundation of similar not-pale-enough color but I&#039;ll update this review when I find one close to my natural skin tone. I&#039;m hoping the extremely pale will counteract the layer of tan I have laid down. However, if it doesn&#039;t I&#039;m going to settle as using this product as a pure redness-counteractor instead of an all-over primer. 

It isn&#039;t heavy, it doesn&#039;t break me out, the SPF is sufficient, it&#039;s not overly shiny, it could be used as a foundation if you are tan...I would buy this again",2016-07-22T20:34:00.000Z,2906623,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3524588.JPG,MissHalcyon,5,Very Oily,Fair,Unknown,Brunette,Unknown,Unknown,Brown,19-24,2
321,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,2,76243,Super City Block Oil-Free Daily Face Protector Broad Spectrum SPF 40,3,"First of all, for any pale people who might be reading, this product is not suitable for very pale-skinned individuals who have cool/pinkish undertones. I’m a bit pale even for a redhead, and very cool. Even with a lot of blending and light application, this product looked orange on my skin. I returned it after trying it a couple of times.

There are a lot of good points about it, however. It feels nice and light. It has SPF 40 and very light coverage—sheer, really—which is why I bought it. It resembles a tinted moisturizer, although I’m not sure if it actually claims to be a moisturizer. I didn’t find it terribly moisturizing, but I have some dryness on my face. It can even out colouring somewhat, but I wouldn’t count on it to cover up any significant issues. I wore it on a very hot day with a small amount of translucent powder dusted on top and it stayed quite nice and fairly matte into the late afternoon.

I really wanted to like this product, but again, it just didn’t work because of the colour mismatch. I’m giving it three lippies because of it’s not a bad product otherwise, but I would expect something with 40 SPF to suit a wider range of very pale people.

Unfortunately, this didn&#039;t fit the bill. It felt wrong the moment I applied it, very sticky and greasy. It completely disintegrated my makeup and left my face very shiny. 
As this seemed to last so poorly on my skin, I also don&#039;t think it delivered enough sun protection. I definitely won&#039;t buy this again and was quite disappointed as it was fairly expensive. It&#039;s frustrating because whenever I search for a sunscreen that&#039;s suitable for oily skin, this stuff is sure to turn up.

321,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,6,76243,Super City Block Oil-Free Daily Face Protector Broad Spectrum SPF 40,4,"I&#039;ve used a lot of facial sunscreens and prefer mineral. I settled on Badger tinted Rose SPF 20. Love it. But I&#039;ve noticed that it tends to sting my Retin-A sensitive skin. I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s all of those essential oils. That fact, coupled with me wanting a higher SPF on some days, caused me to search for something new.
Super City Block uses both physical and chemical. It&#039;s pricy for a 1.4 oz tube. Ingredients are good, IMO. Clinique claims, like with most of their products, that it is suitable for sensitive skin so I thought I would try it. The tint is more yellow-toned than pink, FWIW. 
My verdict: Good stuff. Spreads easily. I didn&#039;t experience any balling up. No real smell, and the after feel is just slightly dewy but not greasy. If the finish isn&#039;t matte enough, dust some translucent powder over it, I use LancÃ´me Absolue. This combination is perfect for me, skin looks polished and natural, and it&#039;s what I wear daily. I don&#039;t need much coverage and prefer Supercity over a BB-type cream. When I do want more coverage, I mix it with a liquid foundation and it plays very well. It has a bit of a blurring effect when worn alone, but doesn&#039;t offer any real coverage. It did not irritate my skin in any way. Nor does it sting my eyes. Consistency is that of a thin lotion. The tint works well with my skintone, so I don&#039;t get any ashy results, although tanned or deeper skin tones might? I also don&#039;t use a lot, just about a pea size amount for my face and a bit more for my neck. It can be mixed with foundation to help with color matching, too. I don&#039;t find it super moisturizing, but I don&#039;t care. It&#039;s sunscreen. I use moisturizer underneath as needed. 
They offer a non tinted version, but I actually prefer the tinted, as it functions as my daily &#039;foundation&#039;. The tube is small and fits in my purse, I reapply a few times if I&#039;m going to be out all day. 

Will/have repurchase(d). Add: on my 3rd tube, still love it.

The mineral SPF is what attracted me to this product.  Chemical sunburns burn my face even if I wait 30 minutes after cleansing.  The only chemical sunscreen that I can wear is the LaRoche-Posay SPF 15 moisturizer, which is excellent but doesn&#039;t have a high enough SPF for my moderately fair skin.

The girl recommended City Block and swore that it wouldn&#039;t break me out and that it was more than suitable for my skin. 

I put it on the next day, it felt great on my skin, didn&#039;t make it oily and I loved the colour-corrector. Fast forward a week later and my face is covered in cystic ance and little whiteheads.

Not only that but if I sweat and try to wipe sweat out of my eyes, it gets in my eyes and it burns.

So far I have not experienced that with Super City Block. I was told by the Clinique girl that it was made to be worn underneath makeup and can act as a primer as well.

I originally discovered it in one of those tiny sample size tubes I had received as part of a free gift. I work in international development so end up in very hot countries where I end up not wearing too much makeup. This product is actually fantastic. You know you are protected from the sun, which I definitely need or I tan 6 different shades on my face, and it evens out your skin. I wear it alone, no foundation. On days where I don&#039;t have it on I usually wear liquid foundation so its that or this -  but this really does the trick and I&#039;m beginning to prefer it over foundation. 

It takes about 10 minutes to soak in, and my skin is glowing after. I usually place some on the back of my hand (a dab less than the size of a dime in diameter) and blend it on to my face using my fingers. I&#039;m of South Asian background so I medium brown skin and the tint I guess works. In the past year I have used it in countries where the temperature and humidity levels have been extreme and this product is my go-to. Highly recommended.

I love this stuff. Only reason it doesn&#039;t get 5 lipsticks is because it&#039;s still basically an expensive tinted moisturizer. I hate that BB with SPF products I&#039;ll have to reapply within a couple of hours are priced like they&#039;re long-wear foundations. 

But, it&#039;s a great BB cream that moisturizes enough that it replaces my separate moisturizer step in the warmer months (hot, humid summers where I live). 

The trick to this is not judging the amount you need by how it looks immediately upon application. Too much looks streaky. Too little means ineffective sun protection. I find it best when worked in a little with fingers then dabbed with fingetips to even out, rather than with a brush. It will look a little pale and shiny at first, but soaks in well within 10 minutes. 

It does what a BB/tinted moisturizer is supposed to do - evens out skin tone and provides sun protection, except this one actually moisturizes effectively. Doesn&#039;t irritate me. My favorite thing about it is that if I need a little more coverage, I can powder the T-zone  without City Block turning into a pore-highlighting medium.

Before that, I found this a bit drying, but now after changing my skincare, I think it was my skin in general that was too dry, rather than this product actually causing it, but I think if you do have very dry skin, this may not be for you.
I was using another sun protector before this, that was okay, it did the job, but I&#039;m not sure my skin loved it, like it it seems to love this.  Before it was tolerable, now, my skin looks 100% better with this on.
As it has not seemed to annoy my skin, as I have not had any cystic acne bumps come up, I can pretty much wear this without having to put foundation on now (first time in ages).  I put a bit of powder on and concealer on one or two slightly stubborn acne scars, if I am in the office, but if not, I literally wear just this now, it really gives my skin a nice finish, and seems to even the tone out nicely.

Not terrible but I have had better. It gives your face a nice sheen matte look which I do like but I have dry skin so I look drier on certain days and definitely shows the flaky skin. Not too bad for $22 at Sephora but id rather use paulas choice skin recovery spf 30 moisturizer.

This is an Oil- free product, therefore if you have dry/combination skin the product will ball up around your face. Make sure you prep the skin 100% and hydrate well before add this product. 

Result:   i got red cheeks from the first day. Even when i retried it again a month later, it gave me the same reaction. This time i wore it for 2 days and the skin around my nose/chin/cheeks/forehead started feel burnt, whiteheads appeared around the top of the nose which i never had in my life. 

Not recommand this if you have sensitive skin. Paula Begoun noted that this have few natural ingredients that can effect the skin.

Edit: i applied again after a year and same thing happend. hahaha good bye to this product!

Works as a primer under foundation. Seems to protect from the sun. Nice slippy texture but not greasy.  I apply it over moisturiser and under foundation. If you don&#039;t use foundation it might suit you like a BB cream.

Downside- to get good sun protection you need to use a good dollop- not just a smearing.  This can cause some bubbling of the product. You also can&#039;t really re-apply during the day if you are using foundation over the top of it.

It leaves a greasy film on the face, as well as a noticeable white cast. The greasiness on the face in turn leads to grease getting near your scalp and getting your hair oily. Honestly if you want a sun protectant that has a matte finish try Sun Sense Daily face indivisible tint finish SPF 30 75 grams. Mine you SPF 40 = 2.5% of the suns rays reach your face, and SPF 30 means 3.33% reaches your face. The difference is minor. This one takes a few minutes to dry but once settled it does not leave a white cast or greasy finish. It has a very very very minor soft stickiness but that is not even noticeable. For those who are concerned just apply a loose powder on top. Best of all it costs 12 dollars, that&#039;s 25% the price I paid for clinique&#039;s city block. I&#039;m kicking myself.

I can&#039;t stand to put regular body sunscreens on my face which is already super-oily and acne-prone all on its own, and in my search for a good face sunscreen I discovered this one.  It has a weird chunky texture coming out of the tube but it&#039;s consistency is very light and watery so you can apply many thin layers instead of one gross thick layer.  I took this stuff with me on various vacations to hot and humid destinations and upon my return, people said my face didn&#039;t tan.  And I tan very easily.  This means one very important thing: the sunscreen was able to withstand my oily, sweaty skin.  My skin also didn&#039;t break out from all the layers of sunscreen.  Here&#039;s what I do: apply a thin layer.  Allow to dry.  Repeat twice.  No thick layers, or it will pill.  And apply with a very light touch or it will pill.   It has a very slight tint.  I like this tint because it is a yellow tint that tones down the perpetual redness of my face.

I fell in love at the store, because it didn&#039;t leave a white cast on my HAND, and not exactly white, but a little bit tinted, but when I came home and smoothed it on my face I saw the same white cast, which my Cera Ve  spf 30 moisturizer has.
This spf 40 protector says its oil free, but oh my...! Why it feels so oily and sticky on my skin, which is currently not oily and it&#039;s not the hottest time of the year. And it gets worst in the middle of the day!
 I thought it will be good for summer, but no way!!!!! I&#039;m going to stick to my Cera Ve, it&#039;s not oily at all.

MA said to me that she gonna take out a fresh one to me. This left me with thought that they may sell expired or close to expiration creams. Not even consistency and weird smell  kind of fortified my suspicion.
Whatever it is it had to go back.

It also looks a little thick for a sunscreen... I like that it can be used as a primer, also that it gives good sun protection, and it doesn&#039;t irritate my skin.

I apply a moisturizer, super city block, primer, foundation then powder and have had no issues with my makeups longevity.  I believe Clinique claims it can be used as a primer, however I choose to use my own.  I have fairly dry skin and will always use another moisturizer.  If you have normal skin, you might not need moisturizer with this.  I have had no issues with my makeup &quot;balling up&quot;, or experienced any sensitivities.  I hate using foundation with sunscreen in it, additionally I don&#039;t feel like the SPF 15 that most foundations have will cut it anyways.

The only good thing about this is the 40spf. It is a layer on your face you don&#039;t need, as long as your moisturizer/foundation has good SPF in it. You are better off putting $5 target sunscreen before your makeup if you need the extra protection. 
This is supposedly unscented but all I smell is pickles when I apply it. It leaves a grainy feel on your face(that you can feel and see)
Didn&#039;t do much as far as coverage, priming and it definitely does not moisturize!
It is a very thick consistency, yet not moisturizing at all. Makes skin feel heavy and unnatural. 
Will never purchase this again, usually I like Clinique but this was a big miss on there part!!!

I was pretty skeptical at first as I&#039;d asked for a primer and the assistant recommended this. Even more concerned when she tried it on my hand and it looked like a light foundation (I have tan/olive skin). However, she said it would blend and I purchased. When first applied my heart sank as my face looked white, but as the assistant advised, it soon blended in and you couldn&#039;t see it any more. I wear this over a moisturiser in the weekends and during the week, when I&#039;m at work, I wear with Clinique foundation and it looks great. In fact I think it makes the foundation look even better. Both products together have been good for my sensitive skin, particularly as it is very dry post pregnancy.

It&#039;s not that. It has a beige tint, and on my dark skin, as others have noted here, the product carries a pale cast. If I really, really blend it, the pale cast isn&#039;t so blatant, but I still haven&#039;t been able to use it without foundation. And even with foundation, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the perfect product for me, since it lightens my skin up a bit, my foundation (also Clinique) appears to be a better match without it. 
With that said, I have no other bones with the product.

I then put my MUFE F&amp;B on today and dusted with powder.  it hasn&#039;t devolved into the oily mess that a lot of others have reported.

&quot;I&#039;ve been using clinique city block 40 under makeup more religiously and even back in summer when i was just using it for like 1/2 months then stopped. i noticed both times that the next day my skin would be clear. even if i accidently slept with makeup on after a night out, which would usually make me break out like mad. 

it took a while for me to click that it was when i was wearing it. anyway so for the past month i&#039;ve been using it like everyday and my skin has like 2 teeny blemishes at most, even though it was my totm. what is in it that is clearing up my skin? is it the zinc? or is it because its acting as a barrier from my makeup meaning less clogged pores?

this is most weird because ss makes me break out usually&quot;

Anyway as you can see not only am i enjoying this as an spf in texas and english weather, im also getting miraculously clear skin from it.

It does give a white cast, so i like to wear this with foundation to avoid looking like a ghost. with m/u it doesnt give white cast in photos, infact i rather like how it makes my skin look in photos and real life. it gives shine so i always follow up with powder but i agree with another poster that this makes my skin look more even and healthy. i stepped up my skincare in the last month and noticed one morning after applying this that my skin looked so great as if i were already wearing tm or f/d. i was going to switch up to boire but i think i&#039;m going to stick with this stuff for a long time now :)",2012-12-02T13:04:00.000Z,2403726,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3524588.JPG,lolilea,2,Sensitive,Fair-Medium,Not Sure,Red,Other,Other,Hazel,19-24,10

Also, tho my skin tone is medium-tan, I tan super quick and no sunscreen seems to help prevent that. 10 mins in d sun and I turn 2 shades darker, even if I&#039;m wearing SPF 40 or 50. Perhaps its just my skin :(

Its quite an expensive product but it lasts quite long.

4)The finish is dewy and slightly shiny(which is a bad thing for me)

The sand beige tint gives a natural dewy look. If you want a matte look, just dust with powder and you&#039;re good to go. 

Function wise, I&#039;m extremely easy to be tanned, this sunscreen didn&#039;t help, just like any other sunscreen I&#039;ve used. Reckon it&#039;s a gene thing. Recently I went to a beach city for holiday and came back 2 shades darker. No sunburn tho.

321,112,CLINIQUE,22,Sunscreen,2,76243,Super City Block Oil-Free Daily Face Protector Broad Spectrum SPF 40,1,"Clinque cityblock spf 40 doesn&#039;t work.
I&#039;m actually really quite annoyed.

I have normal fair skin in the winter and I do burn when my skin comes out of winter intially. However SPF 20-30 when I&#039;m on holiday is fine, I have travelled far east and always tanned well. However now that I am entering in my early 30&#039;s I do not want sun to touch my face EVER. 

Also I live in london, SO I bought city block SPF 40 thinking this is maximum protection, if a little over the top for me. This is the 2nd time this has happened to me: Yesterday I went for a walk for maybe 2 hours max. I applied my SPF before leaving the house concentrating on cheeks and nose esp, wore very large glasses. At no point was I sunbathing in direct sunlight, if I was it was for all of 10-20 minutes on and off walking, I was walking under trees, shade, had my hoodie up as it did get chilly, but the direct sun did feel strong. it was about 18 -20 degrees in direct sunlight.

About and hour later out of the I felt very hot and very red cheeks. The next day i now have a small white patch where my glasses had been and rosey cheeks, tightness, i feel like I have a very very very mild sunburn (Caught the sun). if this is supposed to be spf 40 this should not have happened. So I&#039;m questioning the strength of the SPF in this product. After all I&#039;m in England and it&#039;s spring not even summer. I chatted to a girl at work who also uses it and she said she sometimes wondered if it  worked. She is very fair and has always used it and is not the sort of person that would go into direct sunlight and she said she too gets rosey checks and freckles. So I&#039;m actually very angry that this is being sold as spf 40, which seems to be acting more like spf 15 if that. I&#039;m trying hard to protect my face, and you can&#039;t avoid going outside, thus spending money on this product which has failed me. The most worrying thing is that it says you can put it on babies aged 6 months? As a product it&#039;s fine i.e primer, moistureiser, i do find it a little greasy. but for me the main concern is the spf. There is no way you should burn using a spf 40.

If anybody has any comments about what I have raised please contribute, I would like to know if anyone has had these problems? I would like to think maybe I got a dudd bottle? Please feedback. i&#039;m kind very upset this has happened. It would be nice to find a product that is not too chemical, that actually protects your skin from the sun without being harsh on chemicals.

Many thanks.

I usually use Shiseido ultimate sun protection cream, but thought I&#039;d give this a try.

I like that it doesn&#039;t feel oily on my skin, but noticed that if I leave it on for a bit too long without blending, (about 10-20 seconds) then it starts to peel off if I try to rub it in.  The package says it can be used as an under-makeup primer so I suppose this is the effect of the primer ingredients.  

I like that it&#039;s tinted so it leaves less of a white cast on my pale Asian skin than the Shiseido sunblock, but I can&#039;t really testify to its sun protection powers.  I usually use my face sunblock on the backs of my hands as well but this sunblock makes it look like I have foundation on my hands.

I have used the City Block products in various incarnations for almost 20 years. A product I started in my teens. It does feel thick going on, but then vanishes into the skin.  Because it has zinc it doesn&#039;t irritate my skin - yah! It really works for me, and I do believe because it was so easy to use and stayed on that I wore my sunscreen every day - which I don&#039;t always do unless it is in my moisturizer. Doesn&#039;t cause me to breakout, if I am in a rush works as both a sunscreen &amp; some tint. Only problem it that if I use this alone now I am a bit older -and didn&#039;t use sunscreen while I was pregnant &amp; breastfeeding to get some Vit. D&#039;s so got some skin damage- this has so much zinc in it that I look noticeably ghostly. I have to put something on top. The old 15 version had a couple of tones - one which was a much more skin matching tone that you could use if you wanted to skip makeup in the summer - which I often did.
Grumbles. 
But still I think this is a great product works for me, and if they discontinue their City Block product line...I will sulk for weeks and mourn for years.",2012-01-29T13:00:00.000Z,2234776,thumb/h/145/1_1_8_1_3524588.JPG,skeptic11,3,Combination,Fair,Not Sure,Brunette,Other,Other,Blue,36-43,18

As for price, sunscreen in general is quite pricy and decent brand face creams with sunscreen also run pretty pricey-yes this product&#039;s a bit costlier but it last a really long time.  My last tube lasted me about 6 months-so that works out to about $45.00 a year for a high SPF, non-irritating, tinted cream.  
I like Clinique but am not a major fan-they have a few okay products, so I&#039;m not writing this as a product devotee-I&#039;m writing it as a long time searcher for a great spf face product.

Ok.. so its not dirt cheap but its not that expensive. it costs aroung £15 and it last for aaages so its worth it in the end.
I purchased this because I was going away on holiday to Croatia in the summer so it would be very hot and sunny. I have the tendancy to burn (plus i like to look after my skin and not get wrinkly!) so i decided i needed a better sun screen than my No7 spf 15 which would not be much good in the Croatian heat. 
It doesn&#039;t irritate my skin (I have silly sensitive skin) plus it has a lovely colour to it. For those who don&#039;t like the tint to it, you would look really pale without it so surely it&#039;s a good thing?!!! It can act as a base for make-up. It&#039;s not as thick as foundation but it does leave a nice tint.
It&#039;s spf 40 which is very good, alongside a PHYSICAL sun block which is why I purchased it. And I didn&#039;t burn! Normally my nose and forehead go red but I didn&#039;t suffer at all.
If it leaves your face really oily you are using way too much. Of course yuou need it to cover your face but you don&#039;t need layer of it on.
I still use it now even for the winter. It makes my skin look really clear and dewy. I normally put on a little loose mineral power for a perfect flawless look :)

The SA said that the Super City Block SPF 40 was the same, just with more SPF.  It is not the same at all!  The SPF 40 version is terrible and I wish I could return it.  Half the time when I apply it, it rolls off my face.  

I&#039;ve tried it on bare skin, over moisturizer, over serums, over primers, used my fingers, a sponge, a brush, tried using it very sparingly and tried slathering it on.  It doesn&#039;t sink in, but just sits on the surface like a pudding skin and if I try to pat it in or rub it in or whatever, it balls up and rolls off in flakes.  What doesn&#039;t roll off falls into my pores making them look like white dots.  I give up.  

It&#039;s too bad because I love the tube packaging and like that it has a bit of tint and the high SPF.  It could be a great all-in-one product, but I suspect there&#039;s something about the SPF 40 formulation that causes the balling/flaking. I do not have that problem with the city sheer SPF 25.

I felt my face so oily that time, then I bought this clinique super city block (I chose SPF 40, because the sales assistant said it&#039;s more long lasting and suit to my pale skin). And voila! I felt my skin was much more less oily and it also brighten my face. So, it doesn&#039;t matter if I can&#039;t use powder for 2 days!
